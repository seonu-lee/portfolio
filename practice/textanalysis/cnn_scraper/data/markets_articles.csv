"Trump is about to announce Powell’s replacement. One finalist backed Democrats, higher taxes and more immigration","President Donald Trump plans to announce his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair on Friday morning. Among the finalists is one man who checks many of the boxes: BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. The influential investor has the respect of Wall Street and deep knowledge of complex financial markets. Rieder is believed to prefer lower interestrates, a top priority for a president whowants massive rate cuts. And Rieder looks the part. His frequent television appearances areplaying well inside the White House. No wonder Riedervaulted to the top of the listof Fed chair candidates on prediction markets over the past few days. That changed Thursday night, when Trump said his pick wouldn’t surprise people, and “a lot of people think that this person could have been there a few years ago.” That strongly suggests former Fed official Kevin Warsh, who was a finalist for Fed chair in 2017, when Trump ultimately picked current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Warsh was at the White House Thursday shortly after Trump slammed Powell as a “moron.” But it certainly doesn’t eliminate Rieder, who still has better chances on prediction marketKalshithan White House economist Kevin Hassett and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller. And yet some of Rieder’s prior comments on Trump policy priorities, his lack of government experience and political donations to Trump critics could work against his candidacy for the powerful position. Rieder, a dark-horse contender for the Fed job, has in the past criticized one of Trump’s signature legislative achievements during his first term: slashing the corporate tax rate to 21%. “I think 21% is too low,”Rieder told CNN in March 2021. The BlackRock exec argued the benefit to business is “too high,” pointing to the fact that many corporations used their tax savings to reward shareholders with massive share buybacks. During the 2020 campaign, Joe Biden proposed raising the corporate tax rate. Rieder said at the time that the US economy could “definitely” withstand raising the corporate tax rate. “I would imagine he didn’t bring that up during his interview at the White House,” quipped Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. It’s not clear if Rieder still favors a higher corporate tax rate, which is not something the Fed chair has a direct say on in the first place. A BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment on Rieder’s five-year-old comments. During that same 2021 interview, Rieder downplayed inflationconcerns bubbling up at the time. He said inflation could accelerate to around 2.5% but stressed he wasn’t worried about “explosive” price increases. Rieder’s comments put him within the then-consensus among economists and even Fed officials who believed inflation would not become a persistent problem. But by June 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, broken supply chains and aggressive stimulus from the federal government, inflation skyrocketedto a four-decade high of 9.1%. Rieder may also have some policy differences from Trump on another top priority: immigration. In April 2023, Rieder voiced support for the exact opposite of Trump’s currentimmigration crackdown. Echoing concerns of many mainstream economists, Rieder said the United States needs more, not fewer, foreign-born workers to offset retiring baby boomers. “In most economies around the world, you need immigration,” Rieder saidduring a Morningstar podcast. He pointed to airlines, hotels and other companies that “can’t operate at full capacity” because they “just can’t find enough labor.” “With an aging population and, like I say, without immigration, it’s really, really hard to fix that,” Rieder said during the podcast. Indeed, USjob growth slowed dramatically last year– in part because thesupply of workers has declined sharplyas Trump has ramped up deportations. In sharp contrast to Rieder’s arguments in favor of immigration, the White House last week hailed negative net migration in 2025  – the first in half a century – as among Trump’s“365 wins”in his first 365 days back in office. “For the first time in 50 years, we are now seeing reverse migration,” Trumpsaid last weekduring a White House briefing. At the same time, Rieder has donated in recent years to Democrats including HouseMinority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Cory Booker and former Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, according tofederal filings. The BlackRock exec has also given money to Republicans, including Never Trumpers such as Nikki Haley, Jeb Bush and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Of course, campaign donations have almost nothing to do with Rieder’s ability to do the job of Fed chair. But they could hurt his case at the White House, given today’s hyper-partisan environment,Trump’s history of retaliatingagainst perceived foes and his desire to pick a loyalist for the job. Larry Kudlow, the conservative Fox Business anchor and former Trump economist, called out Rieder’s donations to “the never-Trumper” Haley and “ultra-left-wing” Democrats earlier this week. “Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett understand Trumponomics. They can be independent but still understand that the supply-side economic boom does not cause inflation. No one can be sure, though, about Wall Streeter Rick Rieder,” Kudlow wrote in a column forThe New York Sun. Asked about Rieder’s prior campaign donations, White House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump will announce his pick for the Fed “at the appropriate juncture.” “Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone’s time,” Desai said. Unlike Warsh and Hassett, Rieder’s resume also has a noteworthy gap: a lack of government experience. According to former Fed official Vincent Reinhart,all 10 Fed chairssince 1935 had a prior position in the executive branch. Powell, for instance, worked in the Treasury Department during the George H. W. Bush administration, while former Fed Chair Janet Yellen was a top economist in the Clinton White House. Rieder’s lack of government experience could steepen the learning curve if he were to get the job. On the other hand, this contrast with prior Fed picks could make Rieder even more attractive to Trump, who is not shy about busting norms. After all, neither Trump nor many of his Cabinet picks had previous government experience. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, told CNN that Rieder’s prior positions and campaign donations could make for “awkward moments” during a potential confirmation hearing. “But is there a smoking gun? Not yet,” Mills said. “And for Trump, having someone who has been in the private sector is a huge asset. Rieder is known and respected on Wall Street. And the market always tests the new Fed chair.” Mills said Trump knows he needs a strong economy and stable markets for Republicans to avoid a bad outcome in the midterm elections this November. The reality is there may be no perfect pick who checks all the boxes Trump is looking for in a Fed chair. For instance, Hassett favors lower rates but is viewed by some on Wall Street as too loyal to Trump – and that could backfire byroiling the bond market. Waller and Warsh are respected by investors but may be too independent for Trump’s liking. “The problem is none of the candidates have all the characteristics Trump wants: someone loyal, dovish and credible to markets,” Roth said.",2026-01-30T01:23:47.477Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/economy/trump-federal-reserve-powell-rick-rieder,Matt Egan,markets,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26012742302241.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:25:31
Jerome Powell’s remarkable advice to his successor speaks volumes about his battle with Trump,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell refused to answer three straight questions about politics during his press conference Wednesday. That’s typical for the just-the-facts persona he’s constructed for himself over the years. But near the end of his lengthy question-and-answer session, Powell got reflective and let the cat out of the bag. When CNN’s Matt Egan asked what words of wisdom Powell would give his successor, who is set to take over when Powell’s term as chair ends in mid-May, the Fed chair paused for a moment, chuckled, and said he had three pieces of advice. It was a touchingly human and thoughtful response. And it spoke volumes about the legacy Powell plans to leave at the institution he’s served for 14 years – nine as its chair. On Wednesday, he summed it up as his commitment to the “public well being” and staying out of politics. The Trump administration’s crusade against the Fed has threatened the institution’s independence that Powell holds so dear. He has said the Fed needs to remain independent to maintain its credibility that allows it to serve the public by working to keep unemployment and inflation low. The stakes are so high that the Fed leader deemed it appropriate to attend the oral arguments in the Supreme Court case of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who is challenging Trump’s attempt to oust her. For Powell, none of that is political, but rather a fight for the Fed’s independence. Over the past year, President Donald Trump and his allies have unleashed an unrelenting barrage of attacks against the Fed, claiming it has been too slow to lower borrowing costs. But it hasn’t been just name calling: The administration is actively arguing before the nation’s highest court why Cook, appointed by then-President Joe Biden, must be removed. Powell’s reflection, though never mentioning Trump or his actions, seemed aimed directly at the president. If passed through a Fedspeak translation engine, it might look something like: Because of Powell’s career-defining work to maintain the Fed’s independence, Trump’s attacks on the Fed are now backfiring. Instead, they have rallied support for the institution’s political independence, which the president has long sought to undermine. Trump’s campaign against the Fed took a shocking twist earlier this month, with federal prosecutors investigating part of Powell’s congressional testimony last year that touched on an ongoing renovation of the central bank’s Washington, DC, headquarters. The Fed chief pushed back against the administration in a stunning video released on January 12, describing the federal probe as a “pretext” to destroy Fed independence and usher in a world where “monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.” Powell hints at extended pause on rate cuts but stays mum on Trump attacks On Wednesday after the Fed announced it is holding rates steady, Powell refrained from commenting further on his statement against Trump, but he reiterated that Fed independence has “served the people well.” As Powell hinted at on Wednesday, several members of Congress — including some Republicans — have come out in support of Powell. But, more broadly, they spoke of how the Fed must operate beyond Powell’s term as chair. Current and former Fed officials are also standing up to Trump’s attempts to undermine the Fed. “Everybody is in favor of Fed independence,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of research at financial services firm Societe Generale. “I’m not surprised there’s been overwhelming support and that’s exactly the kind of affirmation of Fed independence that markets are looking for.” Several senators — from both parties — came out in support of Powell and the Fed after the central bank chief’semergency video statement. That’s key because some of them serve on the Senate Banking Committee, which will consider Trump’s pick to replace Powell. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a committee member, said in a statement he will “oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved.” He was joined by two other Senate Republicans, who don’t serve on the banking committee: Sens. Lisa Murkowsi of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both of whom said the Fed must remain independent. Still, other Republicans, even some close Trump allies, aren’t siding with the administration, instead striking a more modest tone in defense of Powell. For example, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, a Republican on the Banking committee, told reporters: “I would be stunned if he had done anything wrong.” Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, another Republican committee member, said Powell is “bad” at his job, but added: “I do not believe, however, that he is a criminal.” Fed officials have always supported their ability to set interest rates free of politics by merely pointing to long-standing evidence in academic research that an independent central bank often leads to better economic outcomes. But some current and former officials have been digging in their heels on why the US central bank must continue to manage rates without considering the president’s demands. Earlier this month when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the landmark case of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who is suing against Trump’s attempt to oust her from her role as a monetary policymaker over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, in attendance were Cook, Powell, Fed Governor Michael Barr and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke. When asked Wednesday why he attended, Powell said the Fed’s independence was at stake. “I would say that case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed’s 113-year history, and as I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn’t attend,” Powell said. Current Fed officials have tended to shy away from weighing in on Trump’s attacks, but several have come out in support of Powell in public appearances since, such as Fed presidents John Williams of New York and Alberto Musalem of St. Louis. Shortly after the Fed chief released his video, a joint statement signed by all living former Fed chairs – Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Alan Greenspan – stated its support for Powell’s defiance of Trump. The letter – also signed by other former high-ranking government officials, such as former Treasury secretaries Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin – said that the federal probe “is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence.” “This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,” they wrote. “It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success.”",2026-01-29T09:00:46.604Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/economy/federal-reserve-independence-trump,Bryan Mena,markets,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2250476325-20260128164014812.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:25:44
