CNN’s guide to the most important elections of 2026,"This year’s midterms will not only shape the final two years of Donald Trump’s presidency; they’ll determine what politics after Trump might start to look like. A series of races that starts with primaries on March 3 will either preserve Republican majorities in Congress, helping Trump to push through his agenda, or give Democrats control of either the US House or Senate and the ability to stop his legislative priorities and open investigations into him. Along the way, candidates and party leaders will dissect the results as they prepare for the 2028 presidential race, which will be the first national election in 16 years without Trump’s name on the ballot. Here are the key dates and contests they – and we – will be watching over the course of the next year: Texas is home to blockbuster Senate primaries on both sides that will tee up one of the year’s most high-profile contests – a race that is poised to offer clues about the types of candidates voters are looking to lead their parties – where tone and tactics might shape the outcomes more than policy proposals or ideology. Incumbent GOP Sen. John Cornyn is beingchallengedby state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. The Democratic contest featuresRep. Jasmine Crockettandstate Rep. James Talarico. Democrats will also choose a nominee for governor to run against incumbent GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, who is seeking a fourth term. There’s seemingly less drama in the outcome of the Senate primaries in North Carolina, where formerDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooperandformer RNC chair Michael Whatleyappear headed toward a key general election clash. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin’sretirementhas sparked a crowded field of Democrats seeking to replace the veteran lawmaker. Among the top contenders: Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, who is backed by Gov. JB Pritzker, and a pair of Chicago-area House members, Reps. Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi. The Ohio Senate race is effectively set, with GOP Sen. Jon Husted and former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown on a collision course for the November general election. Ohio has shifted from a perennial battleground to a reliably red state, but Brown is key toDemocrats’ hopesof flipping the Senate. The Buckeye State also has an open contest for governor with GOP Gov. Mike DeWine ineligible to run again because of term limits. On the Republican side, former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is the favorite while former Ohio health director Amy Acton is the top Democratic contender. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy is facing a challenge from Rep. Julia Letlow, wholaunched a primary bidin January after receiving Trump’s endorsement. Cassidy has largely supported the president’s second-term agenda but has voiced concerns about the administration’s moves on vaccines and was one of seven GOP senators who voted to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial in 2021 following the attack on the US Capitol. Other Republicans running include State Treasurer John Fleming and state Sen. Blake Miguez. Louisiana’s switch to a partisan primary system could also be a factor. If no candidate receives a majority of the primary vote, the top two finishers would advance to a June runoff. Georgia Republicans will pick a Senate nominee to challengeJon Ossoff, the lone Senate Democrat seeking reelection this year in a state Trump won in 2024. A contest that will offer clues about the GOP’s future direction features Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins as well as former college football coach Derek Dooley, who is endorsed by Gov. Brian Kemp. Both parties also have gubernatorial primaries in the race to succeed Kemp, who is term-limited. The Republican field includes Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state who resisted Trump’s pressure campaign to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia, and Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who served as afake elector seeking to falsely certify Trumpas the winner that year. Trump has endorsed Jones. Democratic contenders include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former GOP Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and former state Sen. Jason Esteves. Loyalty to Donald Trump andthe legacy of Mitch McConnellare the political forces that have shaped the Republican Senate primary in Kentucky, where Rep. Andy Barr, former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron and businessman Nate Morris all have ties to the retiring GOP senator but have instead touted their pro-Trump credentials. These candidates all interned for Mitch McConnell. Now they’re attacking each other for associating with him Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie will also face Trump-backed primary challenger Ed Gallrein. The president’s allies have made it a priority to knock out Massie as he’s become a thorn in Trump’s side on several issues, notably overthe release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. There’s a crowded field to replace California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Democratic candidates include former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, former Rep. Katie Porter, billionaire and climate activist Tom Steyer, Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. On the Republican side are Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative media personality Steve Hilton. Under California’s primary system, all candidates run on the same primary ballot and the top two, regardless of party, advance to the general election. Iowa could offer clues about whether Democrats are able tomake inroadsin more rural states. Democrat Rob Sand, the state auditor, is seeking to succeed outgoing GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds. The Republican field includes Rep. Randy Feenstra and farmer Zach Lahn. The state also has an open Senate contest following GOP Sen. Joni Ernst’s decision not to seek reelection, with Rep. Ashley Hinson the favorite on the Republican side and a full field of Democratic contenders that includes state Sen. Zach Wahls; state Rep. Josh Turek, a two-time Paralympic gold medalist in wheelchair basketball; and Marine Corps veteran Nathan Sage. Democrats are hoping that 2026 is the year they finally defeat Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins, who has a proven track record of outperforming her party in the blue-leaning state. The question facing Democrats this year is whether Gov. Janet Mills, the favorite of the party establishment, or progressive Graham Platner, an oyster farmer and combat veteran, represent the best chance of accomplishing that goal. Some in the party worry Platner’s past controversial social mediapostscould jeopardize the party’s chances against Collins, while others on the left see Mills – who would be the oldest freshman senator ever elected – as unlikely to excite base voters. In South Carolina, the GOP primary for governor will be closely watched as a gauge of the mood of Republican voters in a key early state ahead of the 2028 nominating process. Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, state Attorney General Alan Wilson and Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman are among the contenders to succeed Gov. Henry McMaster. Rep. Elise Stefanik’sdecisionto end her gubernatorial bid left Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman as the sole major Republican vying to challenge Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is facing a primary from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado. The star power in the Empire State may be in the 12th Congressional District, where a wide field is seeking to succeed longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler. The Democratic primary includes state assembly members Alex Bores and Micah Lasher, longtime Republican lawyer turned Trump critic George Conway and Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of former President John F. Kennedy. Michigan is a state that has it all. There is an open race for governor that features rising stars in both parties: Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on the Democratic side and Rep. John James on the Republican side. A potential wildcard in the race is Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who left the Democratic Party to run as an independent. Democratic Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist ended his bid for governor in January and launched a run for secretary of state. With Democrat Gary Peters retiring, the state also has an open Senate race that Democrats must hold if they stand a chance of winning the majority. The top contenders in that primary are Rep. Haley Stevens, seen as the favorite of the party establishment, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, and Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive who is a former executive director of the Detroit Health Department. Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, who lost a 2024 bid for Senate against Democrat Elissa Slotkin, is running again. In Arizona, there is a crowded GOP primary for governor battling to challenge Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs in a crucial battleground state. Trump has endorsed both business executive Karrin Taylor Robson and Rep. Andy Biggs – while Rep. David Schweikert has also launched a bid, opening up a key House seat. This day will serve up two big tests of the Democratic Party’s direction with an ideological clash in the Minnesota Senate race and a wide-open contest for governor in Wisconsin. In Minnesota, moderate Rep. Angie Craig and progressive Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan are facing off for the Democratic nomination and the chance to succeed retiring Sen. Tina Smith. The GOP field includesformer sportscaster Michele Tafoya. The state will also host an open race for governor after Democrat Tim Walz’s decision not to seek reelection to a third term. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar launched a bid in January, pledging to unify the state as it finds itself at the center of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. GOP contenders include state House Speaker Lisa Demuth and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. Sen. Amy Klobuchar launches bid for Minnesota governor: ‘We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is’ In Wisconsin, the decision by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to not seek reelection has drawn a large field of contenders that includes former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who narrowly lost a 2022 Senate bid, current Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez ",2026-01-09T10:00:59.653Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/09/politics/2026-election-calendar,Terence Burlij,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/primary-calendar-hp-art-largetease.png?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:19:24
Sheriff believes Savannah Guthrie’s mother was abducted: ‘She did not leave on her own’,"The mother of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie is still missingMonday night after being taken from her Arizona home more than a day earlier, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos, who said the investigation into her alleged abduction is ongoing. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen Saturday around 9:30 p.m. near her home, where she lives alone in the Catalina Foothills area near Tucson, the sheriff said. When asked whether Guthrie was kidnapped, Nanos told CNN’s Erin Burnett, “I’ve been doing this for 50 years. I have a gut feeling.” Evidence found at the scene also indicates Guthrie was removed from her home in the middle of the night against her will, said Nanos, who did not provide more details about the case. The sheriff also declined to comment on whether any evidence indicates Guthrie was hurt, saying, “I just can’t really speak to that right now.” “We also believe she was taken from her bed but cannot speak as to why,” Nanos told CNN in an email Monday. Officials do not know what time Guthrie may have been taken, Nanos added. Guthrie has mobility issues and is without daily medication that is critical to maintaining her health, according to Nanos. “The family has told us 24 hours without those meds could be fatal, and here we are at 30 plus hours,” Nanos said Monday night. “This is not dementia-related. She is as sharp as a tack,” Nanos said Monday. “The family wants everybody to know this isn’t somebody who just wandered off.” When Guthrie did not show up to church Sunday morning, a church member called her family, who went to her home around 11 a.m. to look for her, the sheriff said. A family member called 911 around noon Sunday to report her missing, Nanos said. Homicide detectives were sent to Guthrie’s home, in a non-standard move, according to Nanos. And what detectives found at the scene was “very concerning,” the sheriff said. “We believe now, after we’ve processed that crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime scene — that we do in fact have a crime,” Nanos said during a news conference Monday. No additional updates are expected Monday, according to the sheriff’s department. Authorities have Guthrie’s cell phone, said Nanos, and havedescribed the circumstances as suspicious. Nanos says authorities have received a lot of leads but “nothing specific” to the investigation. Downloading security camera footage from the home is now the main priority for investigators, Nanos told CNN. Private companies such as Google and Apple have also offered their assistance, Nanos added. An up-to-$2,500 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of a person or people involved in the disappearance, according to a poster by the 88-Crime nonprofit organization,sharedby the sheriff’s department late Monday. The sheriff’s office has also set up a tip line, urging the public to share information with investigators, and said it is seeking photos and videos that may help with the investigation. “Every detail matters. Even small tips could make a difference,” the department said in a Facebook post. While local law enforcement is leading the investigation, FBI agents from across Arizona are “fully engaged” and are offering numerous technical resources to local authorities, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Agents are assisting with analysis of data from cell phone towers near the Guthrie home, the source said, which is an FBI specialty often offered to support missing persons and fugitive cases. Local and federal authorities are canvassing nearby residences and businesses for any security camera footage that may assist in identifying a possible suspect, the source said. Search and rescue teams, including volunteers, dogs, border patrol agents and helicopters, were also dispatched. Police do not believe there is a threat to the public, Nanos said. “Everybody just wants to be able to know that they can go outside and enjoy their community and come home and be safe at night in their rooms, asleep in bed, and this lady wasn’t able to accomplish that,” Nanos said Monday. “We need her back. We need to find her, and time is very critical.” The “Today” show led with the news on Monday morning and shared a statement from Savannah Guthrie, who said, “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.” “We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department at 520-351-4900.” Guthrie reiterated her gratitude for the public’s support on Instagram late Monday. “Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy,” shewrote. She described her mother as “a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant,” and asked supporters to “raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment.” The “Today” anchor then quoted from the Bible: “He will keep in perfect peace those whose hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord,” ending her post with a solemn message: “Bring her home.” Savannah Guthrie,whose father died before her senior year of high school, has spoken highly of her mother and their close relationship. When the anchor was offered her first news job in Butte, Montana, at the age of 21, her mother encouraged her to pursue the role, despite the distance from home. “It’s not because she didn’t want me to stay. Of course she wanted me to stay,” the “Today” anchor recalled. “But she’s like, ‘I’m not going to stand in the way of your dreams.’” This story has been updated with additional information.

Venezuelan oil is key to Trump’s Russia plan. There’s a problem with that,"President Donald Trumpmade a bargainwith India this week thatintroduced a simple calculus. The reality isn’t that simple. Venezuela’s crude operation isn’t yet up to snuff, and India can’t easily turn its back on Russia. But it’s a start. Trump can still use Venezuela’s newlyopen-for-business oil industryto fight Russia on economic terms and limit its ability to continue its devastating war with Ukraine. India and China make up the vast majority of Russia’s oil sales. Western countries have sanctioned Russian oil since the start of the Ukraine war, so those Indian and Chinese oil purchases are crucial to help keep Russia’s economy afloat. Its heavy, sour crude is remarkably similar to Russia’s — it’s the thick, sludgy stuff that is perfect for making the fuel oil, diesel, asphalt and other derivatives that India’s booming economy needs. America’s light, sweet crude, by contrast, is great for making gasoline — but not much else. And India’s refineries are well-positioned to handle Venezuelan-type oil. After the United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3, Trump laid out the welcome mat for US oil companies to start drilling. The South American countrypassed legal reformslast week that could help bring back foreign oil companies to revitalize Venezuela’s dilapidated oil infrastructure. “It is definitely a step in the right direction, and it will help pave the way for higher investment in the country,” Homayoun Falakshahi, lead crude research analyst at Kpler, said about Venezuela’s just-passed oil industry reforms. But the good news pretty much ends there — at least for now. Venezuela has been producing only a hair over1 million barrels of oil per day, roughly two thirds of which gets shipped to its largest customer: China. Even if Venezuela sent 100% of its oil to India, it wouldn’t make up for the 1.5 million barrels of oil India imports from Russia each day. Venezuela has that potential: It’s sitting on the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Before former President Hugo Chavez’s socialist government came to power in 1999, the country was producing more than 3 million barrels of oil per day. But its infrastructure has long since crumbled, and it would take tens of billions of dollars each year over the course of a decade to get back to that production level, industry experts widely agree. That would take foreign investment and cooperation from major Western oil companies that have so farbeen hesitantto devote the resources needed to power Venezuela’s revival. Just after the United States ousted Maduro, America’s energy industry said that topersuade oil majors to return, Venezuela will need to establish the rule of law, ensure long-term political stability, a repeal of its nationalist oil laws and repay billions of dollars in debts. The United States would also need to repeal its sanctions and offer some form of financial guarantees. Only two of those things have happened so far: The Trump administration got rid of sanctions, and Venezuela revised its oil laws. Trump said debt repayments, security and financial guarantees would not be part of the bargain with oil companies that choose to go back to Venezuela. And despite the fact that Venezuela’s acting President Delcy Rodríguez is playing ball with Trump for now, there’s no chance Venezuela can guarantee its current government will continue to honor any deal struck with Western oil companies over the long haul. And US oil companies will still need to pay the country a hefty royalty on their oil production. That calls into question whether oil majors can get the same return on their investment there as in other countries — particularly when oil prices are so low — noted Rob Thummel, a senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. Although Trump said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to stop buying Russian oil, that can’t happen overnight. India would need to make big infrastructure upgrades, noted Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management. “The adjustment of the global supply distribution chain will take time, especially noting the transit time differences between Russian imports and Venezuelan imports for India,” Haworth said. India would also need to pay a hefty premium over the Russian Urals oil it’s buying now. Russian oil trades at a significant discount — roughly $16 a barrel — to OPEC or US crude, making it hard for India to quit. (Falling global oil prices have made that calculation a bit easier for India to accept.) But India has been flouting Western sanctions by buying Russian crude off ofshadow fleet vesselsfor years — and there are no signs it’s about to stop, even after reaching a deal with Trump, noted Robert Yawger at Mizuho Securities. “There’s been a zillion different ways they have been able to outflank sanction authorities,” Yawger said. Venezuelan oil adds a welcome X factor into the Russia equation that could one day change the status quo, at least somewhat. Russia has already been hurt by falling oil prices, and its economy is struggling because of global sanctions. High inflation and growing debt have made life even more difficult for Russians. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s economyisn’t all that close to collapsing. Russia has managed to expand through a combination of increased manufacturing, shadow oil fleets and higher taxes. Losing India as an oil customer is unlikely to deal a fatal blow. Still, weakening Russian oil sales could make a difference, even if India only gradually weans itself off Russian crude. “Over time, this may create additional challenges for the Russian economy,” said Haworth. That would make the war in Ukraine harder for Russia to fund. And in a war that haskilled nearly 2 million people, something is better than nothing.",2026-02-03T05:01:46.816Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/03/business/venezuela-oil-russia-india-trump-tariffs,David Goldman,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2257239059.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:19:45
Trump slashes tariffs on India after he says Modi agrees to stop buying Russian oil,"President Donald Trump on Monday announced he would reduce tariffs on Indian goods in exchange for, among other things, a promise tostop buying Russian oil. That will be a tall task: India has been importing roughly 1.5 million barrels of Russian oil each day — even months after Trump placed tariffs on Indian goods as punishment — according toKpler, a global trade data provider. Russian oil makes up more than a third of India’s overall imports. Trump said in a social media post that he spoke Monday morning with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who agreed to replace the country’s Russian crude imports with oil from Venezuela and the United States. Modi welcomed the reduced tariffs in aposton X, but he did not mention cutting purchases of Russian oil. Venezuelan oil is of the same quality as Russian oil — heavy, sour and perfect for making derivatives like fuel oil and diesel, which India’s refineries are already set up to process, noted Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. It’s not clear, however, how long that transition may take. Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is dilapidated and requires about a decade of work and tens of billions of investment dollars to return it to the more-than-3 million barrels a day output it had achieved before the country’s Socialist government took control in 1999. India also buys more oil from Russia than Venezuela produces. “Fully replacing Russian oil with oil from Venezuela or the US will take significant investment,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Asset Management. “But. over time, this may create additional challenges for the Russian economy.” India is a major purchaser of Russian oil, which has beensanctionedby most Western countries because of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war with Ukraine. China buys significantly more Russian oil than India — and unlike India, China hasn’t faced additional tariffs for purchasing Russian oil. Turkey is a distant third. Indian government officials have defended purchasing Russian oil previously, calling it essential to the country’s energy security. India is the world’s third-largest consumer of oil, and Russia is a close-by seller. India relies on its crude to support its fast-growing economy, fueled by the world’s largest population. And Russian oil has traded at a significant discount – roughly $16 a barrel – to OPEC or US crude, making it hard for India to quit, noted Robert Yawger at Mizuho Securities. Even after this agreement with the United States, Yawger said he expected India may flout sanctions and purchase Russian oil, as it has throughout the past several years. “There’s been a zillion different ways they have been able to outflank sanction authorities,” Yawger said. “They’ll find a way to go dark fleet and get those barrels moved.” (Dark fleets are ships that use murky tactics to transport oil for pariah states.) But as oil prices have come down over the past several months, the difference in price between sanctioned oil and non-sanctioned oil eroded, allowing India to make a change. “When oil prices were high, that was big. But with oil prices coming down, that advantage is not so substantial,” noted Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economic adviser for India’s government. “If you throw into the calculus that Indian exporters were suffering from Trump tariffs, it became easier to stop buying Russian oil.” US crude prices were down 5% to about $61 a barrel on Monday, but that was mostly unchanged from before Trump’s announcement. Oil fell sharply earlier in the day because traders were hopeful the United States would reach a deal with Iran without striking the crude-rich country. That could imply the oil market remains skeptical that the Indian deal means much at all. “India has been slow-walking these trade talks for months, and the terms here are so vague that they could be anything from major to nothingburger,” said Scott Lincicome, an economist at the Cato Institute. Trump said Indian goods would immediately face an 18% tariff, down from a 50% – a rate that had included an additional 25% tariff Trumpput in place in Augustto persuade India to stop purchasing Russian oil. A White House spokesperson told CNN that Trump will fully remove the additional tariff and reduce the so-called reciprocal tariff. Indian goods had among highest tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration. Because of various exemptions, the effective tariff rate on Indian goods was roughly 35%, according to Subramanian. Trump, calling Modi “one of my greatest friends,” also said India’s prime minister agreed to reduce India’s tariffs on US goods to zero, and to remove unspecified non-tariff barriers. Although Trump didn’t explain which barriers would be removed, those often include special taxes on US companies’ services or value-added taxes on goods. India also pledged to invest in American goods “at a much higher level” in addition to a $500 billion invesment in US energy, technology, agriculture and coal among other products, Trump said. Trump may have been eager to cut a deal with India after the European Union signed a long-soughtfree trade agreementwith India last week, noted Subramanian. “If India gives preferential access to the EU, US business is affected,” he said. “There has been a domino effect.” Although India isn’t one of America’s largest trading partners, the reduction in tariffs could nevertheless make a meaningful dent: The United States imported $95.5 billion in goods from India in 2025 as of November, 3% of the value of total imported goods, and it exported $42 billion of goods there over that time, according to the US Census Bureau. Among the top goods the US imported from India last year are computers and other electronics, such as phones, pharmaceuticals, apparel and chemicals. Jewelry prices in the United States have risen in recent months in part because of tariffs on India. Meanwhile, India’s top imports from the US were oil, gas, airplanes and airplane parts. Beyond goods, corporate America has grown increasingly reliant on India. Companies including American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and Google have deepened their footprint in India, hiring workers there rather than sponsoring visas to work in the US and even opened new offices there.

Savannah Guthrie was getting ready to cover the Olympics. Then came the ‘worst phone call of her life’,"Savannah Guthrie was supposed to fly to Italy on Monday for NBC’s much-anticipated coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics. But instead, Guthrie spent a heart-wrenching day in Tucson, Arizona, supporting a massive search for her 84-year-old mother, Nancy. The elder Guthrie’s disappearance became national news on Monday as authorities described her home as a “crime scene” and asked the public for help finding her. NBC mobilized its considerable resources to help one of the network’s biggest and best-loved stars. Guthrie’s co-hosts on the “Today” show shared the Pima County Sheriff’s Department’s tip line phone number, 520-351-4900, all across television and social media. This story “hits too close to home for our newsroom,” anchor Tom Llamas said Monday night, leading “NBC Nightly News” with the missing person case. “The sheriff there tells me she was taken against her will from her bed in the middle of the night,” Llamas reported. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Savannah and her family right now.” Guthrie, a 19-year veteran of NBC, joined the “Today” show cast in 2011 and was promoted to one of the main co-host chairs just one year later. Over the years she has added other roles, including co-hosting NBC’s coverage of the Olympics opening ceremonies, which she was scheduled to host again this Friday at the San Siro Stadium in Milan, alongside sports commentator Terry Gannon. Guthrie was also slated to anchor NBC’s first night of prime time Olympics coverage because the usual anchor, Mike Tirico, will be in California for the Super Bowl. With that big international trip coming up, Guthrie spent much of last weekend with her husband and two kids. But her plans were shattered when a family member called her and said Nancy was missing. It was “the worst phone call of her life,” said an NBC producer who knows Savannah personally. Authorities in Pima County, Arizona, said Nancy’s family members searched her home in vain before calling 911 to report her missing around noon local time on Sunday. A source familiar with the matter said Savannah immediately scrambled to fly to Tucson. On Monday morning, Pima County sheriff Chris Nanos said Savannah had been in touch with his office, and “she has a security team that’s been in touch with us throughout the night.” The NBC host called herself a “daughter of the desert” in a “Today” show segment about her Tucson roots last fall. In the segment, Savannah and Nancy dined together at a local restaurant — one of many times the host featured her mom on the morning show. Nancy called Tucson “wonderful” during the segment: “Just the air, the quality of life is laid back and gentle.” “I like to watch the javelinas eat my plants,” she added with a laugh, referring to pig-looking animals that are often seen in the area. Savannah’s family history is well known to “Today” show fans. Nancy and her husband Charles lived in Australia, where Charles worked as a mining engineer, when Savannah was born in 1971. The family relocated to Arizona when Savannah was young. Charles died of a heart attack when she was starting senior year of high school. “We lost my dad suddenly and shockingly,” Savannah recalled in a 2023 interview. “And my mom was so strong, and set aside her own grief in many ways, just to be there and make sure we could all move forward together.” On Monday, Savannah issued a statement on behalf of her family, thanking law enforcement and saying “our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.” The “Today” show typically relocates to the site of the Olympics for a long stretch of the games. It almost goes without saying that Savannah’s Olympics plans are on hold. An NBC spokesperson had no comment on any changes, but a source familiar with the matter said Guthrie will not host the opening ceremony telecast. Anchors and reporters across the network shared prayers for the Guthries on Monday. Llamas ended Monday’s “Nightly News” by saying, “Tonight, we’re asking for your help” to find the elder Guthrie. “If you know Savannah then you know her mom — because she raised her, through some very tough times,” Llamas said. “Savannah has shared that it was her mother who taught her the power of prayer, the types of prayers that make you get on your knees and pray for God’s protection. Savannah and her family need your prayers tonight. They also need your help.” “Savannah,” Llamas said, “we know how strong you are, we are praying, and we won’t stop until you find her.”",2026-02-03T01:43:01.418Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/media/savannah-nancy-guthrie-missing-olympics,Brian Stelter,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2205084291.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:03
"Elon Musk’s SpaceX acquires xAI, merging his two most ambitious companies","SpaceX has acquiredxAI, the company announced on Monday, merging two of Elon Musk’s most ambitious companies into the most valuable private company in the world. “This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI’s mission,” Musk said ina statementon SpaceX’s website. The merger could be seen as an indication of the cash xAI needs to compete in the fast-growing field of AI, as well as the technology’s importance in future of space exploration. SpaceX was valued at $800 billion as of a secondary share sale in December 2025, and xAI was valued at $230 billion as of their most recent funding round in January, according to PitchBook, a research firm that tracks the valuation of private companies. The movealso shows the scramble tech giants like Musk’s companies are going through to secure more computing resources to power artificial intelligence advancements. “Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial data centers, which require immense amounts of power and cooling,” Musk wrote. “The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space.” SpaceX sought permission on Friday from the Federal Communication Commission to launch a constellation of 1 million satellites into orbit. The filing said the aim is to provide a network of solar-powered data centers to “accommodate the explosive growth of data demands driven by AI.” Musk said he estimates that the “lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space” within two to three years. Musk is the latest tech leader to call for more computing power in the age of AI. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangtold CNBClast year that next-generation AI models will require “100 times” more power than older models. AI is expected to spike data center power demand by 165% by 2030, according toGoldman Sachs. And tech giants have been pouring billions into AI-related infrastructure to meet that demand. Microsoft last week reported it spent $37.5 billion in the last quarter of 2025 on capital expenditures like data centers, while Meta spent $22.14 billion. At the same time, some US residents have reported seeing their electricity bills surge. ABloomberg News analysislast year found that in areas near data centers, electricity costs rose as much as 267% compared to five years ago. But higher electric bills isn’t the only concern about the technology. Musk’s xAI alsoowns his social media platform X,whose chatbot Grok recently came under fire for producingsexual imagesof mainly women, many of them real people. The AI chatbot was also criticized last year for a series ofviolent and antisemitic posts, which the company apologized for and blamed on a systems update. Investors are lining up to pour cash into AI anyway. ﻿In January, xAIannouncedit raised $20 billion dollars from investors, including from Fidelity Management & Research Company and the Qatar Investment Authority. There was already plenty of crossover between xAI and SpaceX well before the acquisition. Several employees worked at both companies, such as Christopher Stanley, a principal security engineer for SpaceX since 2018 who has been X’s senior director of security engineering since 2022. But some people who have worked at xAI have publicly expressed concern that the two companies are set up for a culture clash. “xAI prides itself on ‘move fast and break things,’ flat hierarchy, act first ask questions later. (It isn’t fully this, but tries to be) I have a hunch many xAI people will hit culture shock w/ SpaceX,”wroteBenjamin De Kraker, a former staffer on xAI’s human data team. Musk confirmed in December he was planning aninitial public offeringfor SpaceX, which was founded in 2002. That Wall Street debut, reportedly valued at about $1.5 trillion, could be one of the largest in history. And that was before the merger with xAI. Both SpaceX and xAI have had no trouble raising money from investors eager to participate in their growth plans. But being publicly traded would increase the ability of the companies to raise capital. That proposition that could add to Musk’s already staggering net worth. He’s worth $676 billion, according to Bloomberg’s real time Billionaire tracker, making him the richest person in the world. A combined SpaceX and xAI public could dramatically increase that net worth.

It’s been a weird few days on Wall Street,"Wall Street traders are grappling with sharp swings in precious metals, bitcoin is hovering at its lowest level since April and there are lingering nerves about technology stocks. It’s been a weird few days on Wall Street. Gold and silver, considered havens amid uncertainty, have experienced enormous volatility. Aferocious rallyin precious metals this year halted with apainful dropon Friday. Meanwhile, bitcoin slumped over the weekend, tumbling from above $83,000 to as low as $74,570 and hitting its lowest level since April. Bitcoin is down sharply from a record high above $126,000 in October. Andmarkets in Asiakicked off February on a down note: South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index sank 5.26% on Monday and had its worst day since April. Thehottest trades on Wall Streetacross the past year — from precious metals to South Korean tech companies — are experiencing turbulence after enormous gains. Gold surged to a record high above $5,550 a troy ounce on Wednesday before dropping 11% on Friday. Silver plunged 31%. Gold early Monday dropped as low as $4,423 before paring losses and trading around $4,680 as of the afternoon. Wall Street in recent years has experienced instances of so-calledmeme stock mania, where traders rally around a specific company to try and ride a surge in its share price. Some investors say similar themes of exuberance have developed around precious metals as they have become increasingly popular investments. “More recently, some serious froth and leverage entered this asset class…as its continued rally got the attention of individual investors and momentum-based investors alike,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, said in a note. “The recent run up in precious metals feels to have an enormous speculative element,” Jim Reid, global head of macro research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. “While a correction had been increasingly anticipated — and was arguably overdue — the speed and depth of the sell-off proved a stark wake-up call,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note. Hansen said the rally in precious metals and particularly silver — supported by strong demand from Chinese investors — had also been “increasingly driven by FOMO and speculative excess.” “When gold and silver turn into hot topics at dinner tables and in workplaces, it is often a sign that a particular phase of the rally is nearing exhaustion,” Hansen said. While precious metals have seen wild swings, bitcoin — once pitched as a form of “digital gold” and considered an alternative store of value — has languished this year amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is down roughly 10% this year, struggling to gain traction after closing slightly in the red for 2025. Bitcoin traded at around $78,050 as of Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, in South Korea, the market had its worst day in months amid nerves about companies’ spending on artificial intelligence. The drop comes while Wall Street is in the midst of corporate earnings season, and investors are similarly assessing the health of big tech companies’ spending plans on AI. US stocks closed higher Monday morning to kick off February trading: The Dow gained 515 points, or 1.05%. The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.54%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.56%. “While technically stores of value, still with strong long-term fundamentals, the total collapse in precious metals prices shows that any market can become gripped by mania, especially in the age of financialization and gamification,” Kyla Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said in a note. President Donald Trump’s announcement that he tappedKevin Warshas his Fed chair nominee also contributed to a shift in market sentiment. Gold futures were down 1.4% Monday. Silver futures fluctuated between gains and losses and were up 1.7% as of the afternoon. Despite the steep drop on Friday, gold is up roughly 8% this year and silver is up 13%. Trump made his Fed pick. But which Kevin Warsh will show up? South Korea’s Kospi soared 76% in 2025 and so far has been a leading stock market index this year. The country’s stock market has benefited from investor enthusiasm about AI as tech and chip companies have soared higher. Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, said in a note that recent moves in gold, silver, copper and South Korean tech stocks can be categorized as “exuberant” or “parabolic.” Emanuel said his outlook for stocks remains positive, and he expects the S&P 500 to rise roughly 13% this year. “The trader behavior has gone global, where people chase hot names,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “What we’ve seen now is a greater propensity to chase rallies.” “It’s not the same trade, but it’s the same trader mentality,” Sosnick said. US stocks had a remarkable 2025. But international markets did much better Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, who has been long on gold since 2022, said he thinks the sharp drop was an “unwind of crowded positions” as opposed to any “systemic risks.” Hansen at Saxo Bank said attention will turn to China, as investors there have been key drivers of demand for precious metals in recent months. Local prices in China have traded at a premium to the benchmark London market. Wall Street this week will get a slate of corporate earnings results including from tech stalwarts Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN) that could influence market moves. Investors in the coming months will also be attuned to Warsh’s remarks during his confirmation hearings for the Fed chair role. “It’s a market to watch for vulnerabilities and extremes,” said Darrell Cronk, CIO for wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo. The US dollar index was up 0.63% on Monday after rising 0.74% on Friday and having its best day since June, stabilizing after a recent slide. The rebound in the dollar can also put pressure on gold, which tends to benefit in a weaker dollar environment. Still, Deutsche Bank is sticking with its call for gold to hit $6,000 a troy ounce by the end of the year. “Significant institutional investors have signalled the probability of a gradual multi-year diversification away from dollar-denominated assets, and we are not aware that this has changed,” Michael Hsueh, research analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note.",2026-02-02T15:31:19.118Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/investing/gold-silver-bitcoin-us-stock-market,John Towfighi,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258484005.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:17
January jobs report will be delayed due to partial government shutdown,"For the second time in four months, a federal government shutdown has caused critical economic data to go dark. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will not release the January jobs report and other closely watched labor market data as scheduled this week because of the partial federal government shutdown. BLS officials told CNN on Monday that the agency is suspending the collection, processing and dissemination of economic data until federal funding is restored. “The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey release for December 2025, Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for December 2025, and the Employment Situation release for January 2026 will be rescheduled upon the resumption of government funding,” Emily Liddel, associate commissioner for the BLS’ Office of Publications and Special Studies, said via email. Prior to the shutdown, the latest JOLTS report, the metropolitan employment data, and the jobs report were scheduled to be released Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, respectively. Once funding is restored, those three reports will be rescheduled, she said. The US government partially shut down on January 31 after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on funding, an impasse sparked by outcry over the Department of Homeland Security ’s immigration enforcement actions inMinnesota–specifically the shooting deathsof US citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents. Senate Democratsvowed to blockthe House-passed bill unless several reforms were made to DHS or unless DHS funding was spun off separately — changes that would require another vote in the House. The government isn’t expected toreopen until at least Tuesday, when the House is expected to hold critical votes on a must-pass funding package. The latest funding lapse comes at a time when the BLS and other federal statistical agenciesare still trying to recoverfrom the last one, a historic, 43-day shutdown that spanned October and early November. The BLS data that was due out this week was expected to provide a crucial look at the health of the US labor market after what wasthe weakest year of jobs growth outside of a recession since 2003.",2026-02-02T18:40:21.091Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/economy/us-shutdown-january-jobs-report-bls,Alicia Wallace,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2244628019-20260202180515675.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:24
Companies are ditching business with ICE,"The backlash against ICE has grown beyond US borders. Capgemini, a major French consulting and information technology company, said Sunday it will sell a US division that does business with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Like other businesses with links to ICE, Capgemini has come under scrutiny as criticism mounts over the agency’s heavy-handed enforcement tactics. Jim Pattison Developments, a real estate company, and Hootsuite, a social media company, are two Canadian businesses that have faced public pressure for their links to ICE. Anti-ICE marcheswere held in several major US cities over the weekend in response to the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants, which has resulted in thefatal shootingsof two US citizens by ICE agents in Minneapolis. Capgemini’s decision follows revelations that the Department of Homeland Security had awarded the US division in question a$4.8 million contractin mid-December to provide ICE with “skip tracing services.” Skip tracing is the process of locating people who are difficult to find, using online information and other sources, such as voter registration data. “The nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm,” Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote in aLinkedIn postlast week. More anti-ICE protests underway nationwide after judge declines to immediately halt Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota The decision to sell the US division comes after a Paris-based corporate watchdog,Multinationals Observatory, published details of the contract, prompting questions from France’s finance and economy minister Roland Lescure. An archived Capgeminiweb pageposted on the watchdog’s website states thatCapgemini was working with ICE to “help it minimize the time required and cost incurred to remove all removable illegal aliens from the US.” In astatementannouncing the sale, Capgemini said legal restrictions associated with government work meant it was unable to “exercise appropriate control” over the US subsidiary’s operations to ensure it aligned with its objectives. Capgemini said the unit represented 0.4% of the group’s global revenue in 2025 and less than 2% of its US revenue. Meanwhile, Emily Lowan, the leader of the Green Party in British Columbia, has taken aim at Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison. Last week, she called on Canadians toboycottthe businesses owned by the Jim Pattison Group, which include grocery chains, packaging firms and car dealerships among others, unless he “cut his ties” with ICE. On Friday, Jim Pattison Developments, which is part of the Jim Pattison Group,saidit would no longer proceed with plans to sell a warehouse in Ashland, Virginia, to the US Department of Homeland Security. It provided no further details. The company has not responded to CNN’s request for comment. The industrial facility was to be used to “support ICE operations,” according to a letter last month from the Department of Homeland Security to officials in Virginia. Hootsuite has faced demonstrations over the work it does with ICE’s public affairs office. Protestors gathered outside the company’s Vancouver headquarters on Friday, calling on it to stop doing business with ICE. “Our use-case with ICE does not include tracking or surveillance of individuals using our tools,” Hootsuite CEO Irina Novoselsky said in astatementlast week. “We understand this is a complex issue and that people will hold strong opinions.” “What we are watching unfold right now is wrong,” she said. “The loss of life and the fear being felt in communities as a result of recent enforcement actions are devastating,” American companies are also taking action to distance themselves from ICE. The owners of a property in Oklahoma City are “no longer engaged with the Department of Homeland Security about a potential acquisition or lease,” according to the city’s mayor David Holt. “I commend the owners for their decision and thank them on behalf of the people of Oklahoma City,” Holtwrote on Xlast week.

Trump’s Kennedy Center closure may leave artists in limbo,"A version of this article first appeared in the Reliable Sources newsletter. You cansign up for free right here. During President Donald Trump’s first term in office, he didn’t even show up to the Kennedy Center Honors. He felt slighted by the performers, so he shunned the event at the famed John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. In his second term, Trump has tried to remake the cultural center in his MAGA image. Trump “was drawn to the institution for its cultural prestige,” Katy Waldman wrote forThe New Yorkerin December, but “he and his allies made it radioactive.” That’s why I’d categorize Trump’s Sunday night announcement about closing the building for a two-year renovation as shocking but not surprising. It did come as a shock: staff found out “via the president’s social media post,” CNN’s Donald Juddreported. But “there had been talk within the organization of a temporary closure at the end of the fiscal year — nominally for ‘renovations’ but also to stem the financial bleed affecting the institution amid the backlash from artists.” Indeed, the numbers tell the story. “In the past year, sales of subscription packages and tickets have fallen dramatically,” The Washington PostreportedMonday. “Empty seats became a common sight at the center.” Equally telling: The sheer length ofan NPR articletitled “Here’s who’s canceled their Kennedy Center performances since Trump took over.” Philip Glass withdraws his ‘Lincoln’ symphony from the Kennedy Center, citing conflicting values Trump’s involvement has been a turnoff to many arts patrons, even as he and his allies have portrayed the president as the venue’s long-needed savior. The flood of performer cancellations accelerated after Trump’s handpicked Kennedy Center board members voted to add his name to the institution last December.dann Trump was at the center just last week for the premiere of his wife’s documentary film “Melania.” So now we’re left wondering, asthis Vulture headlineasks, “Is Trump going to tear down the Kennedy Center?” Will members of the Kennedy family try to stop him? On “CNN This Morning,” Audie Cornish said the rebuilding plan reprises a question related to Trump’s East Wing demolition: “Is this a person who’s renovating because he’s not leaving, or is this a person renovating because everywhere he sees a potential real estate project?” Despite the recent surge in cancellations, a significant number of events are still slated at the performing arts center. The building is home to the National Symphony Orchestra, which performs multiple times per week during its active season. Regular performances of “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “The Outsider” musicals are still on the calendar. “If any forethought was given to the livelihood of the musicians who perform regularly in the Kennedy Center, no mention of it was made in the president’s statement,” Charles T. Downey of the Washington Classical Reviewwroteon Sunday night. The Washington Post noted, “It was not immediately clear what the closure would mean for annual events held at the center such as the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor or the Kennedy Center Honors.” Trump’s new East Wing ballroom is not expected to be ready in time. While short on answers about the impacts, Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell, a vocal Trump loyalist,tweetedSunday night that “this will be a brief closure in retrospect — and I am confident this sets the stage for a stronger, revitalized National Cultural and Entertainment Complex.” While Trump insists this is about fixing a “dilapidated” building, “it’s not the decor that has driven performers away. It’s the decorator,” David Axelrodremarkedon X. “Just like his casinos and other businesses, the Kennedy Center went out of business after he put his name on it,” Brett Meiselas, co-founder of the progressive outlet MeidasTouch,wrote. “Instead of allowing the Center to return to its arts mission, he’d rather close it than admit his vanity project was rejected by the American people,” former GOP lawmaker Barbara Comstockwrote.",2026-02-02T16:34:23.070Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/media/trump-kennedy-center-closed-national-symphony-orchestra,Brian Stelter,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258960824.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:39
Target’s brand new CEO faces a sales slump and turmoil in Minneapolis,"Target’s business is in a slump, competition is bearing down and its hometown of Minneapolis is in crisis from massive federal immigration operations. Michael Fiddelke officially took over as Target’s chief executive Sunday. Fiddelke started his career at Target as an intern in 2003 and rose up the company’s ranks. “We have real work to do,” he said in a public letter Monday. “We are equally clear on the opportunity in front of us.” Fiddelke will aim to recapture the company’s “Tarzhay” reputation for trendy fashion and home furnishings at affordable prices. Target for years stocked shelves with popular designer brands and its own labels such as Threshold, All in Motion and Cat & Jack. The mass merchant appealed to many consumers, but middle-income moms shopping for younger children formed a key customer base. Target’s sales boomed during the pandemic, when customers rushed to buy essentials, home goods and other products. But it’s fallen since then. Decades-high inflation squeezed customers’ budgets in 2022 and 2023, forcing them to cut back on discretionary purchases. Target got stuck with a glut of unsold pillows and laptops. Target also struggled to keep stores tidy and certain products in stock on shelves. Customers complained about long checkout lines and understaffed stores. Target was even late to get some stores ready for key holidays last year. Meanwhile, competition from Amazon, Walmart and Costco has intensified. These companies are larger than Target and have used their size advantage to drive down pricesand attract customers. Target’s sales have stagnated and its stock has dropped nearly 30% over the last three years. “It’s an enormous job. There’s a lot to fix there,” said Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at R5 Capital. Fiddelke also has to navigate a tense political situation in Minneapolis. Target and other big Minnesota companies have faced pressure to respond to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and the killing of two American citizens by federal agents there over the last month. Target has more than 50 stores in the Twin Cities. Protesters have gathered at many of its stores in the region to call on Target to repudiate the administration’s immigration operations, following thearrest of two Target employeesat a store in Richfield, Minnesota. Protestors rallied again outside Target’s headquarters on Monday, Fiddelke’s first day in the office, urging the company to call for ICE to leave Minnesota. This is tricky territory for Target, which staked out strong positions in support of racial diversity and LGBTQ rights under previous CEO Brian Cornell. Those stances drew backlash from conservative customers, and progressive customers grew frustrated at Target when it stepped back from them. Following the killing of Alex Pretti on January 24, Target joined dozens of other companies in Minnesota to issue a statement calling for the “immediate de-escalation of tensions” and for “state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.” Fiddelke also acknowledged the “incredibly painful” violence in Minneapolis in a separate video message to employees. He offered resources and support to staff members shaken by the killings. Fiddelke’s turnaround plans will focus on trying to introduce new brands and spruce up stores. Target is increasing capital spending by 25% to $5 billion to improve store operations, merchandise and technology. Target also recently opened a store in SoHo, the glitzy New York City neighborhood, full of stylish apparel, designer collaborations and beauty products. Target will use the store to test new concepts it may roll out nationally. Shoppers want “great design, real value and experiences that delight,” Fiddelke said in his letter Monday. “That’s where Target has always been at its best, and it’s what grounds the important work in front of us.”",2026-02-02T12:00:45.993Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/business/target-ceo-minneapolis-retail,Nathaniel Meyersohn,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2247871465.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:46
"Stablecoin law allows crypto firms to profit from fraud, prosecutors say","New York’s top prosecutors are raising an alarm on the crypto industry’s first legislative milestone, the GENIUS Act, alleging that the law fails to protect victims of fraud and gives legal cover to companies that are “profiting from fraud.” In a letter exclusively seen by CNN and signed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan’s Alvin Bragg, the prosecutors say the law has provided the “imprimatur of legitimacy” for a kind of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, while allowing firms that issue stablecoins to “avoid significant regulatory requirements that are needed to combat financing terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, and especially cryptocurrency fraud.” The GENIUS Act is a broad bipartisan effort, signed into law in July, to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency that has exploded in popularity in the largely unregulated market for digital assets. The law creates reserve requirements for coin issuers similar to rules that ensure banks hold enough assets to cover their liabilities — meaning firms that issue stablecoins must back their digital offerings one-for-one with liquid assets like US dollars or short-term Treasuries. Trump is primed to cash in on the crypto gold rush he’s helping create But James and Bragg take issue with what the GENIUS Act lacks — namely, language that would compel companies to return stolen funds to victims of fraud. That absence, they write, “will embolden stablecoin issuers, and even provide legal cover, when they affirmatively decide to keep stolen funds and proceeds under their control rather than returning them to victims.” Already, they claim, the two most dominant stablecoin issuers — Tether and Circle —  have throttled law enforcement efforts to seize and return funds to victims while profiting off the crimes that the prosecutors say remain prominent in stablecoin markets. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by volume, has the ability to freeze suspicious transactions of its USDT coin, the prosecutors write. But they say that it has only done so on an ad-hoc basis, and only when working with federal-level law enforcement. “The reality for many victims, therefore, is that funds stolen in or converted to USDT will never be frozen, seized, or returned,” the letter states. “They currently decide on a case-by-case basis when they will assist law enforcement in recovering funds for victims, and nothing prevents them from stopping all reissuance entirely.” Tether said in a statement to CNN that the company “takes fraud, consumer harm, and the misuse of USDT extremely seriously and maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward illicit activity.” The company, which is based in El Salvador, said that it “does not have a blanket legal obligation to comply with state-level civil or criminal processes in the way a US-regulated financial institution would. That said, Tether voluntarily works closely with US law enforcement at the federal, state, and local levels and routinely assists investigations aimed at protecting victims and preventing further harm.” Prosecutors allege that Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, which is publicly traded and headquartered in New York, “claims to be an ally in the fight against financial fraud.” But its policies “are significantly worse than those of Tether for victims of fraud,” the letter states. Even when Circle does agree to freeze funds, the prosecutors say, the company hoards them rather than return them to victims, collecting interest on the underlying assets. Crypto’s slump may be a cultural problem as much as a financial one That creates a “crystal clear” financial incentive to reject requests from law enforcement, the prosecutors say. “It is financially preferable to only freeze cryptocurrency deemed to have been stolen, but not return the underlying asset to law enforcement or any fraud victim, because Circle can continue to collect the interest through investment of the underlying funds.” In a statement to CNN, Dante Disparte, Circle’s chief strategy officer said the company “has always prioritized financial integrity and advancing US and global regulatory standards for stablecoins.” The GENIUS Act, Disparte said, “makes clear that stablecoin issuers must abide by applicable financial integrity rules for combating illicit activity, while enhancing clear consumer protection norms. We have followed prevailing rules as a U.S. regulated financial institution, and we will continue to advance these standards.” The letter, reviewed by CNN, marks one of the most forceful criticisms of the GENIUS Act from law enforcement officials since President Donald Trump signed it in July. While the bill received broad bipartisan support, critics have said it lacks sufficient protections for consumers and raises serious concerns about crypto volatility spilling into the mainstream financial system. And it comes asanother landmark, industry-backedcrypto regulation effort works its way through Congress. Proponents, including major crypto companies that lobbied for its passage, touted the GENIUS Act as a part of the industry’s goal of establishing, in President Donald Trump’s words, “a clear and simple regulatory framework,” for stablecoins, which have become the lifeblood of the crypto ecosystem. The prosecutors’ letter is addressed to Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand — the lead Democratic senator supporting the GENIUS Act —  and Mark Warner, who serves on the intelligence and banking committees. Sens. Schumer and Gillibrand didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson for Sen. Warner said “stablecoin issuers have a responsibility to comply with lawful court orders under the GENIUS Act and to cooperate fully with law enforcement to help victims recover stolen funds… Protecting victims is paramount, and Congress is continuing to evaluate whether additional legislative tools are needed to ensure issuers and law enforcement can act quickly to stop criminal activity and return stolen funds to their rightful owners.” In June, when the legislation cleared the Senate,Gillibrand toutedits potential to “enable US businesses and consumers to take advantage of the next generation of financial innovation.” Stablecoins, as their name suggests, are designed to hold a steady value by mirroring another asset, usually US dollars. One stablecoin should always equal roughly one dollar — a useful function for investors who want to keep their money within the crypto ecosystem without exposing their holdings to the wild swings that bitcoin, ether and other tokens are known for. They’re also seen as a kind of on- and off-ramp between crypto and mainstream financial markets that have historically had little overlap. What are stablecoins? Everything to know about the crypto being debated in Congress Last year, stablecoin transaction volumes soared 72% to $33 trillion, according toBloomberg News, which cited data compiled by Artemis Analytics. While bitcoin remains the most popular crypto token, its trading volume is eclipsed by dollar-pegged stablecoins. That relative stability, combined with the anonymity of crypto transactions, has also proven popular among criminals. Stablecoins now account for 63% of the illicit transactions that take place in crypto, according to Chainalysis, a crypto research firm. And while the crypto industry has beentrying to shedits longtime association with scams, cybercrime, drug trafficking and money laundering, the crime problem is far from resolved. Since 2020, Chainalysis estimates illicit activity on the blockchain — crypto’s core infrastructure — has grown by an average of 25% a year. Thieves and scammers have moved an estimated $28 billion into the world’s most prominent crypto exchanges over the past two years, according to a recent report from theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The New York prosecutors said they “regularly investigate criminal enterprises which use stablecoins to commit cryptocurrency fraud and launder stolen proceeds” and attempt to “freeze and seize” stolen funds to return them to victims. But the GENIUS Act, they say, hamstrings those operations while emboldening stablecoin issuers to resist law enforcement efforts to return stolen funds to victims. “Unlike any other type of cryptocurrency, Circle and Tether have the ability to freeze stablecoins” and “immediately halt the flow of stolen funds and criminal proceeds,” the letter says. Instead, they argue, “Tether has provided assistance only in limited circumstances, and Circle has chosen to actively thwart law enforcement and to profit from victims’ losses.” The prosecutors estimate that in 2024 Circle and Tether each made $1 billion in profits from investing their reserve funds, including reserve funds backing stolen and frozen stablecoins. As of November, they say, Circle had more than $114 million in frozen funds. For crypto critics, the GENIUS Act’s lack of fraud and restitution provisions point to an ongoing problem for the industry, where even basic consumer protections are missing. “All of that mundane stuff that has sort of been sorted out for traditional finance through decades of trial and error – it’s not there in the GENIUS Act,” Hilary J. Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrency, told CNN. “It was always open to the crypto industry to operate under the traditional rules… the laws were never incompatible with the technology.

Trump made his Fed pick. But which Kevin Warsh will show up?,"In June 2008, inflation was running hot — well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target — as oil prices surged. But there was another problem: a subprime housing crisis fueled by toxic mortgage assets. The crisis was so severe that Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns had collapsed just three months earlier. Kevin Warsh, like millions of Americans, was alarmed. Except Warsh, now President Donald Trump’spick to lead the Federal Reserve, sounded more worried about inflation than mass layoffs. “Inflation risks, in my view, continue to predominate as the greater risk to the economy,” Warsh, then serving on the Fed’s powerful Board of Governors, told his colleagues during the June 2008 meeting, according totranscripts. But just months later, unemployment would skyrocket to 10% in what later became known as the Great Recession. Even in the spring of 2009, just months after the spectacular implosion of Lehman Brothers and with millions of Americans out of work, Warsh sounded more focused on prices. “I continue to be more worried about upside risks to inflation than downside risks,” Warsh said during theApril 2009 meeting. Warsh’s crisis-era comments raise questions about just what kind of a Fed chair he will be, if confirmed by the Senate. While Trump has demanded lower rates — the lowest on the planet — Warsh isn’t known as a low-rates guy. Many on Wall Street view Warsh as an inflation hawk, someone who prefers higher rates to keep a lid on prices. In fact, Warsh is considered the most hawkish of the finalists to run the Fed. “The question is: Which Warsh do we get?” Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, told CNN. “The Warsh who was an inflation hawk at the Fed? Or the one who interviewed for this job?” In recent months, Warsh hasadvocated for lower rates, arguing that surging productivity and the AI boom are setting the stage for speedy growth without troublesome inflation. Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase, told clients on Friday that his “best guess” is Warsh will make the case for rate cuts, at least for this year. “We’d also suspect that as time goes on, his leanings will be more open to revision and perhaps reversion back to a more hawkish view,” Feroli wrote in a report, “particularly as we get past the midterms and into the last innings of a presumably lame duck administration.” Tellingly, JPMorgan isn’t penciling in any new rate cuts. Feroli said the bank still expects the Fed will “be on hold for the rest of the year” — even with Warsh potentially at the helm. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, told CNN that Warsh’s 2008-2009 calls on inflation are a “red flag” and evidence that he “got the policy response wrong.” Brusuelas added of Warsh: “His first instinct is hawkish and rarely saw a potential rate hike he didn’t like.” Of course, hindsight is 20/20. Warsh is hardly the only Fed official with comments that did not age well and he did vote in favor of the emergency steps the Bernanke-led Fed took at the time. Still, Wall Street certainly isn’t trading like Trump tapped a low-rate dove to run the Fed. US stocks retreated, the beaten-down US dollar rallied and theprecious metals trade blew up. Gold, which is viewed as a hedge against inflation and a loss of Fed independence, plummeted 8% on Friday. Silver, which had been on fire, crashed 25% — its worst day since 1980. “Kevin Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career and most importantly, during a time when the labor markets fell out of bed,” Renaissance Macro Research, a Wall Street research shop, wrote in apost on X.“His dovishness today stems from convenience. The President risks getting duped.” Trump has described Warsh as the “central casting guy that people wanted.” Warsh’s resume — a former economist under George W. Bush, Hoover Institution fellow and lengthy experience at the Fed — makes him look like a safe pick to lead the Fed under a traditional Republican president. In an alternate universe where Mitt Romney won the White House in 2012, Warsh could’ve become Fed chair. Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor and a mentor of Warsh, said it’s “not correct” to brand Trump’s Fed pick as “always hawkish.” “I’ve seen him go both ways,” Druckenmillertold the Financial Timeson Friday. Warsh has gone the more dovish way of late, a “convenient shift just as he became a Fed Chair nominee,” according to Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. Warsh’s theory of the case is built in part on his long-standing criticism of the Fed’s massive balance sheet. Warsh has said the Fed can shrink its balance sheet so aggressively that it will free officials to slash rates. However, JPMorgan’s Feroli is skeptical, cautioning that a smaller Fed balance sheet would likely lift long-term rates — driving up the same mortgage rates that Trump has been desperately trying to lower. “The balance sheet is wonky, but the real-world implications are not,” said Mills of Raymond James. “The focus on affordability and especially mortgage rates could be completely undone by this Fed pick.” One former Fed official who worked with Warsh is holding out hope that “the real Warsh” will stand up, eventually. “Kevin has wanted this job for a very, very long time. He’s a slick operator, highly skilled at climbing the greasy pole,” the official told CNN on the condition of anonymity. “But this post is his life’s endeavor. Getting it now, only to prove a toadie, would be a Pyrrhic victory. The longer he’s on the job, the more independent he can be.” Trump’s new Fed chair will likely outlast him in office. While Trump’s term in the White House ends in January 2029, the new Fed chair’s term could last through mid-2030. And the new Fed chair could get an assist from the Supreme Court. Justices at the high court, including conservatives,expressed skepticism during a hearing last monthabout Trump’s efforts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, it could give Warsh even more job security in case the president has buyer’s remorse (again). “Did Trump attempting to fire Governor Cook end up backfiring?” Mills asked. “A Supreme Court ruling reaffirming Fed independence will give Warsh more leeway not to be loyal to Trump.” It’s a concern that appeared to be very much on Trump’s mind last month at Davos. “Everyone that I interviewed is great,” Trump said of his Fed selection processduring his speechat the World Economic Forum. “Problem is, they change once they get the job … It’s amazing how people change once they have the job. It’s too bad, sort of disloyalty, but they got to do what they think is right.”",2026-02-02T10:00:47.378Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/economy/kevin-warsh-fed-trump-inflation,Matt Egan,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2211325883.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:01
Her agency crushed her K-pop idol dreams. Her reinvention brought them back to life – and won her a Grammy,"Her voice defeated soul-eating monsters during the emotional finale of the blockbuster animated film “KPop Demon Hunters.” But for Korean American singer EJAE, the triumph gave her something beyond fame and fortune. Years prior, EJAE was an aspiring K-pop star signed to one of the biggest entertainment agencies in South Korea. Starting at age 11, she had endured over a decade of demanding round-the-clock practice. It’s a common path for K-pop wannabes: Sign with an agency, train in dancing and singing, then hope the agency selects you to debut as an artist. EJAE never debuted; her agency let her contract run out without ever selecting her for a group. “I worked hard. I tried my best to make sure my voice sounded cleaner or dance better and to look a certain way. But I think I just didn’t make my mark,” EJAE told CNN in a recent interview. And when the constant competition and pressure began to affect her schoolwork, “I just felt like I was failing at everything.” “For a long period of time after (leaving the agency), I did feel very hopeless,” EJAE added. She’d risked it all, spending her youth on a dream that hadn’t panned out. But EJAE wasn’t done with the K-pop industry just yet. She took one more risk: She reinvented herself as a songwriter. That path led her back to New York and, eventually, to “KPop Demon Hunters.” The movie, the most-watched Netflix original film ever, centers around a Korean girl group that hunts demons with their songs to protect the world. EJAE co-wrote and recorded demos for the chart-topping soundtrack — most notably its uplifting anthem, “Golden,” which won a Golden Globe for “Best Original Song” in January. (EJAE is also the singing voice for the film’s purple-haired protagonist, Rumi.) It’s also up for an Oscar in March. And on Sunday, Golden became the first K-pop song ever to win a Grammy, landing the award for best song written for visual media. “It’s pretty rare for someone like EJAE, who’s a former trainee, to really blow up this big,” said Claire Marie Lim, an associate professor at Berklee College of Music and K-pop expert. Lim, who wasa K-pop traineearound the same time as EJAE, said most people she knew left the professional music world if they didn’t debut as K-pop idols. Some current K-pop stars might be involved in songwriting and production, but it was more unusual a decade ago — especially for former trainees. “The attitude at the time, like 10-plus years ago, was: ‘You’re meant to sing, dance, rap, model, do a lot of forward-facing things, but not really take part in the creative process behind the scenes,’” Lim said. EJAE was pursuing a “super rare” path that she would essentially have to create herself. Ironically, the movie that made EJAE a star is an ode to the Korean pop music machine that disillusioned her all those years ago. “KPop Demon Hunters” reflects how K-pop artists, also known as idols, bask in the glow oflight sticks and fan chants. But in real life, their fame comes with a high price: harsh beauty standards, 3 am call times for broadcasts, public backlash for dating and more. Even becoming a K-pop star often requires years of intense training, spending “hours a day dancing and singing and rapping,” Lim said. On “The Zach Sang Show,” EJAEdescribedgoing to vocal and dance practices after school and staying until midnight. (She also wasn’t the first in her family to pursue a career in entertainment; her grandfather was a famous actor and producer in South Korea in the 1960s and ‘70s.) Themassive K-pop machineis notorious for its artist development and production programs. Agencies meticulously plan out public debuts, coordinate every detail of schedules and fan interactions and even oversee many parts of stars’ personal lives. Trainees are also heavily scrutinized for their skills and appearance, often starting when they’re very young. EJAE was 11 years old when she joined SM Entertainment, one of South Korea’s biggest entertainment companies. “There’s a lot of competition, a lot of critiquing. There were competitions within the training system where I’ve failed a lot and was rejected a lot,” EJAE told CNN. “I’d constantly been hearing, ‘You’re not good enough, you’re not good enough.’” For those seeking K-pop stardom, the path can be long and grueling When her contract ended in 2015, EJAE was in her early 20s— already old for a K-pop trainee. It’s an exceptional case when agencies do debut older idols, “and I didn’t meet that exception,” she said. EJAE described her departure from SM as a breakup: amutualbreakup, but heartbreaking nonetheless. She had spent her formative years enmeshed with the company, and now she was on her own. She’d developed an interest in producing while at New York University, where she studied music during a break from training. Encouraged by her mom and brother, she would go to DJ performances in New York and ask them questions after shows. “‘If you want to get something, you have to be proactive’ — that’s always been instilled in me, and that was honestly the start of my journey of discovering myself as a writer, whether it be producing or not,” EJAE said. She spent hours each day teaching herself to use music software and how to make beats. She was intrigued by production, in part because she didn’t see many women in that side of the industry. While figuring out her next move after SM, she did a studio session with a Korean producer. She  thought they were going to make beats. Instead, he wanted her to write a song. “The last song I’d written…like actually wrote the melody and lyrics — was in college for a project, and it was a Christmas song and it was terrible,” she recounted. “So I was like, ‘What?’” But she gave it a go, and to her surprise, she fell in love with writing pop songs. The song she wrote that day was picked up and released as “Hello” by K-pop singer Hani. Creator of Netflix movie ‘KPop Demon Hunters’: ‘We’ve all wanted to see our culture represented correctly’ Although EJAE never debuted as an idol, the training helped her understand the structures and melodies that would work for songs. Andrew Choi, who would become her mentor, heard “Hello” and brought her onto his team and to SMsongwriting camps. (Choi is the singing voice for Jinu in “KPop Demon Hunters.”) “I think he saw potential in me, which I didn’t see,” she said. “Sometimes it just takes other people to see something in you for you to believe in yourself, too.” Since then, she has co-produced or co-written for a string of big-name K-pop acts, including Twice, Suzy and Aespa. Perhaps her most recognizable hit is “Psycho,” by Red Velvet. For “KPop Demon Hunters,” she’s credited onfour tracks, including “Golden.” Maggie Kang, the movie’s creator and co-director, said she contacted the songwriter at the suggestion of her husband. EJAE was initially brought on as a songwriter in 2019 and offered the lead singing role around 2022. “We cast EJAE first. We had the demos and knew that we wanted EJAE to do the vocals,” KangtoldForbes last July. In a social media post, she said the demos helped the film get the green light. EJAE, for her part, was more hesitant. She had never been cast in a movie before, and, at the time, no one knew “KPop Demon Hunters” would go on to become a global phenomenon. She enjoys being behind the scenes, where there’s less pressure, shesaidin an interview with The New York Times. “What made me say yes is the efficiency,” she said. “I wrote the song; I know the nuances and how to sell it. I was confident about that.” Now audiences are belting out her lyrics, and the music has given the movie a life beyond the screen. “Golden” held the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 for weeks last year, heard everywhere from grocery stores to dentist offices. Other “KPop Demon Hunters” songs similarly dominated the charts worldwide, with hundreds of millions of Spotify streams. We asked kids: Why are you so obsessed with ‘KPop Demon Hunters’? It’s a full-circle moment for EJAE. Twenty years after she hoped to be a K-pop star and 10 years after her dream was crushed, her voice and lyrics are reaching listeners across the world. “Golden” even found its way into global affairs: The leaders of Japan and South Korea recently played the song on the drums together inan usually loud display of diplomacy. When “Golden” won its Golden Globe, EJAE referenced her time as a trainee – and her reinvention. “This award goes to people who’ve had their doors closed at them,” she said, accepting the accolade with her co-writer and producers. “I can confidently say rejection is redirection, so never give up.”",2026-01-27T05:01:46.782Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/27/business/ejae-kpop-demon-hunters-risk-takers,Allison Cho,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2250257105.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:14
"Amazon touts ‘Melania’ box office success, though film well short of turning a profit","Fans of President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have made “Melania” a breakout hit by box office standards. The documentary is on track to earn about $7 million in its opening weekend, with ticket sales reflecting a familiar red/blue divide in America. “Melania” is projected to be the best-performing documentary of its kind in a decade, a takeaway that the first lady trumpeted in a post on X. Then again, “Melania” also received a marketing rollout unlike any other documentary, complete with ads on buses and commemorative popcorn tins at theaters. By financial standards, the film is not a winner, at least not yet. The company that financed it, Amazon MGM Studios, still has a long way to go to break even. On Sunday, Kevin Wilson, the head of domestic theatrical distribution for the studio, said, “we are confident in the long-term value this rollout will deliver to customers both in theaters, and for years to come on Prime Video.” Amazon paid $40 million for the rights to “Melania” and committed another $35 million for marketing — eye-poppingly high sums for a documentary. The Hollywood Reporter called it the “most expensive” such film in history. The exorbitant spending led Amazon’s industry rivals to speculate that the studio was trying to curry favor with the Trump administration by paying the first lady millions of dollars. According to the Wall Street Journal, “the First Lady’s cut is more than 70% of the $40 million,” or at least $28 million. “The Daily Show” host Desi Lydic phrased it as a question on premiere night: “Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?” Amazon asserted that “we licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.” Theatergoers said they did love it. The documentary received an A grade through CinemaScore, an industry-standard survey of theater patrons. The A grade was in stark contrast to the critical consensus. Professional reviewers — who weren’t given a chance to screen the film in advance — have panned “Melania” as a vapid infomercial. Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates film reviews, found only 11% positive reviews as of Sunday morning. “Melania” is not really a documentary at all, but rather a hagiographic “reality TV” special that “preaches to the faithful,” The Bulwark culture editor Sonny Bunch wrote. Bunch called it “fascinating to see so pure and naked an instrument of graft and propaganda deployed to great effect on an audience happy to lap it up.” Amazon MGM rightly calculated that the film would attract audiences across the country, particularly in Republican strongholds. Industry sources said the top-performing markets for “Melania” included Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, and West Palm Beach. Opinions about the film predictably broke along partisan lines. Trump critics shared screenshots of empty theaters in big liberal cites to mock “Melania” while Trump fans shared photos of group outings in conservative suburbs. The film’s opening weekend performance exceeded the expectations of box office prognosticators, some of whom had forecast “Melania” to make just $2 to $5 million over the weekend. The actual $7 million total puts the film on track at No. 3 overall for the weekend, behind the Sam Raimi-directed horror adventure “Send Help” and YouTube star Markiplier’s self-financed film “Iron Lung.” Given that “Melania” won’t be in theaters for long, there is no way that Amazon will recoup its costs from the theatrical release. But box office figures are not the only way to measure success, since “Melania” and three companion TV episodes are going to stream on Prime Video, and the studio can eventually recoup more of its spending via advertising and Prime sign-ups. A streaming premiere date has not yet been announced, but industry experts say most of the project’s overall audience will come on Prime Video. “We’re very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for ‘Melania’ exceeding our expectations,” Wilson said. “This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.” In any case, the suspicion about Amazon’s motives will linger long after the film leaves theaters. A New York Times reporter asked President Trump about it at the premiere on Thursday in Washington, DC. “Amazon paid $75 million to make and market this film,” reporter Shawn McCreesh said. “It’s an exorbitant fee. Many Americans think that this is maybe Jeff Bezos trying to get in good with you, and they would call it an act of corporate corruption.” President Trump interrupted and asked, “Who are you with?” After criticizing The Times, he sidestepped the topic, saying, “I’m not involved. That was done with my wife.” Over the weekend, he played movie promoter on Truth Social, urging people to “check it out” and linking to Amazon’s website for the film. On Sunday morning, the president linked to a news story about the ticket sales and wrote, “BLOCKBUSTER!” Meanwhile, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth isreportedlytraveling to Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sunday to visit Bezos’ Blue Origin, which announced last week that it would pause space tourism to focus on contracts with NASA for upcoming moon missions.

Many Haitians may soon not be able to work in the US. That will make caring for the elderly much harder,"Colin O’Leary recently had the toughest day of his career. The executive director at Laurel Ridge Rehabilitation & Skilled Care Center, O’Leary had to tell 13 of his top staffers — all Haitians with Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS — they were losing their jobs. That’s because the Trump administration is terminating the protection for Haitian TPS holders after February 3 as part of its broader immigration crackdown. Replacing the employees, who care for roughly 115 residents at the Boston center, will take time. They include hard-to-find, experienced certified nursing assistants and dietary aides who know their charges’ needs and habits –  who likes their chicken mixed with mashed potatoes while being fed, who needs extra help getting out of bed and who might be breathing a little more heavily, a potential sign of a health problem. Like O’Leary, elder care industry leaders nationwide are bracing for the loss of a key pillar of their workforce. Nearly 350,000 Haitians are set to lose their TPS this week, and a sizeable share of them care for older Americans. They work as nursing assistants, dietary aides, cooks, maintenance workers and other staffers in nursing homes, rehab centers and assisted living facilities. They also help senior citizens as aides in their homes. The looming departures add pressure to an industry already contending with 350,000 open positions — a shortfall that’s expected to grow in coming years as the nation ages. Overall, immigrants make up more than a quarter of workers who provide direct care in long-term care settings, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Notably, they make up nearly one-third of those who work in home care. The curtailment of immigration is “really creating problems for a sector that is already challenged from a workforce perspective,” said Katie Smith Sloan, CEO of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit providers of aging services. Some of her members already have to rely on costly temporary workers from agencies, while others turn prospective clients away because of a lack of staff to provide quality care. In Boston, the local elder care industry is suffering from a severe staffing crunch, which is only expected to get worse. The city has one of the largest Haitian communities in the US. O’Leary’s tight budget makes it difficult to raise wages to compete for new hires or turn to a staffing agency. Meanwhile, he’ll have to lean on his remaining employees to work a lot of overtime as he rebuilds the team, which he fears could take years. “I felt like I was letting them down as a leader,” he said of his Haitian employees. Haitian TPS holders are among the latest foreign-born residents whose lives are being upended by the Trump administration, which is focused on slashing the number of immigrants entering and living in the US. The Department of Homeland Security announced the termination of TPS designation for immigrants from multiple countries, including Honduras, Nepal and South Sudan, though federal judges have stymied many of those efforts. Many Haitian TPS holders are hoping that a federal judge in the District of Columbia will grant them at least a temporary reprieve. TPS relief applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters. The recipients are vetted and are not eligible if they’ve been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors in the US. The DHS secretary has discretion to designate a country for TPS. Haitian immigrants became eligible after an earthquake rocked the country in 2010. The designation has since been renewed multiple times as the country faces a host of crises, including widespread violence by armed gangs, food insecurity, displacement and a leadership vacuum afterthe president was assassinated in 2021. Several Haitians have sued DHS, arguing the department didn’t conduct the necessary review of whether it’s safe to return. The suit also alleged that the protection is being terminated, in part, because of President Donald Trump’s “racial, ethnic, and national-origin animus towards Haitians.” Asked for comment, DHS said that the Haiti’s TPS program “was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades.” “The assertion that the only way we can take care of our seniors is by allowing unvetted illegal aliens and foreigners with criminal records to remain in the country is grossly false and lazy,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. One TPS holder who cares for a senior citizen in New York told CNN that her heart pounds when she thinks she might have to go back to Haiti, which she fled in 2023. She’s afraid of being killed if she returns, but she also doesn’t know how she’ll be able to survive in the US if she can’t work. “There are a lot of insecurities in Haiti, and then there’s a lot of gang violence that continues to go up,” she said in Haitian Creole through a translator. Meanwhile, she also worries about what will happen to the elderly woman with whom she has developed a connection after caring for her for nearly two years. “She appreciates the help I provide to her,” said the caretaker, who asked that CNN not use her name for fear of reprisal from the federal government. In turn, she is proud that the woman trusts her. Many home care agencies are having difficult conversations with clients and their families, informing them that their caregivers will no longer be able to provide services, said Katia Guillaume, a vice president at Service Employees International Union Local 1199, which represents about 150,000 home care workers in three states. “When you are providing care so intimate as feeding and bathing, you develop a bond with someone,” Guillaume said. “To know that that person is no longer going to be here – when this person is sometimes the only person they see – it’s really hard for the patients. It’s hard for the caregivers. It’s hard for the employers.” Goodwin Living, which provides senior living and health care services to 4,000 older adults in the Washington, DC area, lost four workers from Haiti last summer when the Trump administration terminated their humanitarian parole. It took about six months to replace one of the cooks, said Rob Liebreich, CEO of the faith-based nonprofit organization. Soon, Liebreich expects to part with four more workers – including another cook – from El Salvador, whose TPS will expire in coming months. He fears those staffers will be even more difficult to replace since finding the right people is becoming ever more challenging. Already, Goodwin Living can’t meet the demand for home hospice and home health services because it can’t find enough workers. Now it’s considering whether to build more independent living rather than assisted living units that require clinical staff. “It’s making us think about what kind of services should we offer, what limitations are going to be in front of us in terms of staffing that may limit our ability to provide services,” he said. “And that’s not what we should be thinking about.”",2026-02-01T09:00:47.544Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/01/business/haiti-tps-immigrants-status,Tami Luhby,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1451119452.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:39
Analysis: Is the case against Don Lemon about winning — or about chilling journalism?,"Legally speaking, the federal charges against journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort are complex and unusual, sparking debate among lawyers about the legitimacy of the cases. But politically speaking, it’s pretty simple. The Trump administration wants to punish perceived opponents and raise the cost of critical news coverage. “This moment is bigger than two journalists,” a coalition of 40 journalism and free press groups said. “It is about whether the First Amendment has meaning when reporting is inconvenient to those in power.” Or as Fort herself said in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “Journalism is on trial.” Fort said “two dozen agents” showed up at her home with an arrest warrant early Friday morning. A law enforcement source told CNN that more than two dozen agents were involved in Lemon’s arrest as well. So the twin arrests were partly a show of force by the federal government and an expression of power, given that a magistrate judge rejected the government’s initial attempt to charge Lemon and several others. The Department of Justice, under pressure from prominent MAGA media influencers to arrest Lemon, then took the case to a grand jury and secured indictments that way. President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had no advance knowledge of “the Don Lemon thing,” brushing off reporters’ questions about the matter. He went on to call Lemon a “sleaze bag” and derided his career as a journalist. The White House hadcelebrated Lemon’s arrestwith a mocking post on X on Friday. Seth Stern, chief of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation, said “the charges are absolutely frivolous,” but suggested that a courtroom victory is beside the point. “The Trump administration, I’m sure, knows the baselessness of the charges, just like the lawsuits that Donald Trump files frivolously against news outlets,” Stern told CNN’s Victor Blackwell. Trump has “demanded $65 billion in damages from news outlets. The point is not to win,” Stern said. “He doesn’t think he’s actually going to those $65 billion. The point is to intimidate and chill lawful newsgathering. To make journalists think twice.” Many veteran journalists agreed with that assessment but said they would not be deterred from their work. Lemon himself said Friday night on his live-streaming show, “Now they’re trying to silence journalists. And I will not be silenced.” Administration officials say they are protecting the First Amendment rights of the worshippers who were at church on January 18 when anti-ICE protesters disrupted a service. The indictment alleges that Lemon and Fort were part of a “coordinated takeover-style attack” at Cities Church in St. Paul. Lemon and Fort, however, say they were simply there to report on the protest, not participate. The indictment relies heavily on Lemon’s own live-streamed coverage as evidence. It points out that Lemon previewed the “operation” in advance and said, “We’re not going to give any, any of the information away.” Lemon’s up-close-and-personal videos of the protest inside the church — showing some parishioners rushing to leave and even slipping on the ice outside, and others having tense discussions with the protesters — went viral. Many viewers were offended by the conduct of both the protesters and the journalists. The church disruption soon became a top story for Fox News and other pro-Trump media sources. Commentators sided with the worshippers and villainized Lemon, who has been a prominent Trump foe for years, including during his time as a prime time CNN anchor. Trump appointees in the Justice Department responded — sometimes personally on X — to MAGA demands for legal action. The government charged both journalists with conspiring against people exercising their freedom of religion and violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, known as the FACE Act. That act was created to protect reproductive health clinics and patients, and it also prohibits the use of force or threats to interfere with churchgoers. “To our knowledge, it is unprecedented for the Justice Department to deploy the federal laws cited in this case against journalistic activity,” Gabe Rottman, VP of policy at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told CNN. “Historically, the limited number of cases that have been brought against a journalist documenting a protest on private property have been handled as trespass cases at the state level,” Rottman said. “Those charges are almost always dropped, or if the cases go to trial, the journalists typically prevail.” Numerous First Amendment lawyers have similarly predicted that Lemon and Fort will prevail. Journalists have already been poking holes in the indictment’s dramatic description of the church disruption. For instance, the indictment asserts that Lemon and Fort tried to “oppress and intimidate” the church pastor, while Lemon’s live stream showed him calmly interviewing the pastor. If the cases ever get to trial, lawyers expect that government prosecutors would have a difficult time proving intent. “The government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they had the specific intent to interfere,” Greg Rosen, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted January 6 rioters, said on CNN’s “Laura Coates Live.” Rosen noted that “individuals who claimed to be journalists” were involved in the January 6 attack. Prosecutors did not look “to see what outlet they belonged to” or what they believed; rather, “we looked at what they did,” he said. “We looked to whether we can prove their knowledge, their intent, and their actions… That is something that I think is largely lacking here.” On Friday night, Coates interviewed Nekima Levy Armstrong, who helped lead the church protest, and Armstrong flatly denied that she “coordinated” with Lemon or Fort. “It was a clandestine operation, which meant no one other than the organizers had any information about where we were even going,” Armstrong said. Lemon and Fort were given an address for the protest location, but “they had no details… They didn’t know what was going to happen,” she added. Nevertheless, some Trump-aligned commentators have expressed confidence in the government’s cases. Megyn Kelly, who has a contentious history with Lemon, said Friday on her podcast that Lemon made a “colossal blunder” by going inside the private property of the church. “If he had stayed on that sidewalk, this would not be happening to him,” Kelly said. “But he didn’t. He joined the mob, he disrupted the service, he got in the face of the pastor and other parishioners, he was told to leave, he refused. He’s in a lot of trouble and it’s not because President Trump doesn’t like Don Lemon.” Lemon’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said Lemon will fight the charges vigorously. A wide array of First Amendment advocates condemned Friday’s arrests as something out of the autocratic playbook. “Journalism is not a crime. Reporting on protests is not a crime,” Amnesty International said. “Arresting journalists for their reporting is a clear example of an authoritarian practice.” The New York Times said in a statement that the arrests “continue a clear pattern of ignoring established law and infringing constitutionally protected rights to target reporting the administration finds politically disfavorable.” The Foundation for Individual Rights and ExpressionsaidFriday that the charges against Lemon “raise serious concerns for press freedom.” The group recently asserted that the conduct of the anti-ICE protesters at the church was not protected under the First Amendment. “But that doesn’t mean the federal government’s charges against Lemon — civil rights charges that require evidence he was threatening or physically obstructing congregants or coordinating such activity — are warranted,” FIRE’s director of public advocacy Aaron Terr said. “Manufacturing federal crimes out of the facts we’ve seen so far chills” the core reporting function of the press, Terr said. Referencing the White House’s post mocking Lemon’s arrest and the administration’s other actions against news outlets, he said, “That appears to be the point.” This story has been updated with additional information.",2026-01-31T18:40:13.322Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/31/media/don-lemon-trump-georgia-fort-civil-rights-doj,Brian Stelter,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26030863958925.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:51
Amazon’s layoffs are staggering. We’ve seen this before,"Big Tech continues to wrestle with mass layoffs, most recently with Amazon’s announcement to slash 16,000 jobs. It’s a trend that started long before the AI race: organizational change brought by the arrival of new technology. Tech giants flourish or falter based on their decisions to overhaul themselves, often leaving tens of thousands of workers to pay the price. The 1990s and 2000s saw a wave of layoffs from industry stalwarts like IBM, Hewlett Packard and Microsoft, which embraced technological advancements like personal computers, mobile devices and the cloud. Amazon’s staggering jobs cuts this week, the second wave since October, brings the commerce giant’s recent layoffs to roughly 9% of its corporate workforce. While Amazon’s layoffs aren’t a direct result of AI, they’re tangentially related. Advancements in AI have sparked widespread concern about the future of jobs, as fellow tech giantsMicrosoft,Meta and Verizon all made layoffs last year. AI is the “most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said when announcinglayoffs in October.She added that the company needs “fewer layers” to “move as quickly as possible.” In her memo explaining the new round of layoffs, Galetti wrote that Amazon aims to “strengthen” the organization by “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.” The technology industry has gone through a staggering wave of layoffs throughout 2025 amid growing concerns about the role AI will play in the future of work. If you’ve been laid off by a major tech company recently, we’d like to hear from you. How are you thinking about your career moving forward? Has this changed your outlook on pursuing a career in technology? The technology industry has gone through a staggering wave of layoffs throughout 2025 amid growing concerns about the role AI will play in the future of work. If you’ve been laid off by a major tech company recently, we’d like to hear from you. How are you thinking about your career moving forward? Has this changed your outlook on pursuing a career in technology? Companies are likely shiftingresources to areas like data, automation and analytics amid the AI race, according to Zeki Pagda, an assistant professor at Rutgers Business School. “Amazon cannot easily retrain a workforce built for manual logistics or legacy retail systems into one that builds generative AI agents,” Pagda said in an email to CNN. Amazon pointed CNN to Galetti’s memo when asked for comment. The company also said AI isn’t the reason behind the vast majority of the cuts, and that it will continue hiring in other areas. Galetti also wrote that “broad reductions every few months” are not part of Amazon’s plan. IBM is one of the most prominent examples of mass layoffs in response to new technology. The companylaid off50,000 people in 1993, whenchip technology evolved and the techindustrymoved away from large mainframe computers. Dealing with competition from smaller personal computers, IBM’sbusiness model began turning to services and software instead. “IBM’s challenge is not just to shrink in size but also to remake itself completely into a nimbler and more market-oriented player,” Time magazine correspondent Thomas McCarrollwrote in 1992. In 2014, Microsoft laid off 18,000 workers a few months into Satya Nadella’s tenure as CEO. Those cuts came just after Microsoft had absorbed Nokia’s mobile business, hoping to catch up to Google and Apple in the smartphone market. Ahead of those layoffs, Nadella wrote in an essay that the company needed to “flatten the organization” as it increasingly focuses on mobile and the cloud,The New York Timesreported at the time. There are other factors that contribute to layoffs aside from new technology, like overhiring, the state of the economy and a shift in corporate strategy. Cisco, for example, pivoted its business to stay relevant, according to Pagda. The rise of cloud computing in the 2010s forced Cisco to decrease its reliance on hardware networking equipment. It started investing more in areas like cybersecurity, data center technologies and cloud services, Pagda said — although doing so meantslashing thousands of jobs. Amazon’s big plan to beat ChatGPT: Give Alexa a better memory However,Amazon — a major player in both digital commerce and cloud infrastructure — isn’t at risk of becoming irrelevant, nor is it struggling financially. It raked in $180.2 billion in net sales in the September quarter alone last year and has a $2.5 trillion market capitalization. Still, the goal is tomake necessary changes before hardship. “One could argue this is Amazon’s leadership saying, ‘We’ve got to make these changes now because we see where the technology is headed and we see where the market is headed,’” Rob Siegel, lecturer in management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, told CNN.",2026-01-31T10:00:46.914Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/31/tech/amazon-layoffs-january-tech-changes,Lisa Eadicicco,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258083398.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:59
Trump says he’s decertifying Canada-made aircraft and threatens 50% tariffs,"President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he is decertifying all aircraft made in Canada and threatened a 50% tariff on those planes until American-made Gulfstreams are certified in that country. Trump specifically said he was decertifying the Global Express, a business jet from Quebec-based Bombardier, along with “all aircraft made in Canada.” “Canada is effectively prohibiting the sale of Gulfstream products in Canada through this very same certification process,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If, for any reason, this situation is not immediately corrected, I am going to charge Canada a 50% Tariff on any and all Aircraft sold into the United States of America.” The threat is the latest episode in a prolonged spat between the US and its next-door neighbor since Trump took office last year. Just hours earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he expects Trump to “respect Canadian sovereignty” after reports that Alberta separatists met with US officials. And a few days earlier, Trumpthreatened a 100% tariffon America’s second-biggest trading partner if it struck a trade deal with China. It is unclear whether Trump has the legal authority to decertify aircraft; the White House has not released an executive order on any Canadian aircraft tariffs. Trump did not specify any mechanisms to decertify the planes in his post. No president has ever decertified jets directly. The decision has always been left up to aviation safety experts at the Federal Aviation Administration, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of industry consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory. “Using aircraft safety as a tool in a trade war is just an incredibly bad idea,” he said. Bombardier issued a statement pointing out that it has 3,000 US employees spread across 9 US facilities as well as 2,800 US suppliers. One of such facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana, recently announced plans to expand. “Thousands of private and civilian jets built in Canada fly in the US every day,” Bombardier said. “We hope this is quickly resolved to avoid a significant impact to air traffic and the flying public.” Trump didn’t clarify whether the decertification action would apply to active or yet-to-be certified aircraft. But an industry source who spoke to CNN on background said that it was the industry’s understanding that it would apply to “new” private aircraft. “(There is) no indication from folks we’ve talked to that this would impact passenger aviation like Bombardiers that were manufactured 10+ years ago,” the source said. If Trump does ground all Canadian-made jets, it would be a blow to US airlines and passengers. In addition to business jets, Bombardier produces the CRJ regional jets used on so-called feeder flights. Those typically shuttle passengers from smaller airports to larger airports. United, Delta and American airlines all employ regional airlines for their feeder flights that use CRJ. So far, none of the regional airlines that provide those feeder flights have reported having planes grounded, Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the Regional Airline Association, told CNN Thursday evening. There are 648 passenger CRJ jets that were made in Canada that are in use by US airlines, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Those planes are scheduled to make more than 2,600 flights daily, with a total of 175,000 available passengers seats every day. Grounding those planes would not only cause widespread disruptions to the US airline schedule, it could leave many smaller airports in rural areas without air service. Regional airlines are the only source of flights for 64% of US airports, according to the Regional Airline Association’s data. “I think this is aimed at business (jets),” another industry source, who asked not to be identified, told CNN Thursday evening. “I’m well aware of what the (social media) post said, that it was all aircraft. But I would be really shocked if the intent was to ground the fleet that serves so many of the president’s supporters.” A White House official toldReutersthat Trump was not suggesting decertifying Canadian-built planes that are currently in operation.The White House didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment Friday. The FAA referred questions to the White House. Taking those CRJ jets out of the US air travel system would cause widespread chaos, Aboulafia said. “It would be a transportation disaster,” he told CNN. “If it’s only the Global Express, it’s not that big of a problem. But if it’s all Canadian-made jets … the (US air travel) system would be seriously impacted.” Canadian Industry Minister Mélanie Joly told theCBCon Friday that members of the Canadian government have reached out to their counterparts in the US government about Trump’s post. “When the president reacts, tweets, says something, we always take good note. We read, we listen and we don’t panic,” she said, adding that they believe “this can be resolved.” Steven MacKinnon, Canada’s transportation minister, posted on social media that he had spoken with Bombardier’s CEO as well as senior leadership with General Dynamics, its American corporate parent. Officials with Transport Canada are also in contact with the the US Department of Transportation, he said. “Canada’s aviation industry is safe and reliable. We will stand behind it,” hewrote. It’s also not clear from the Truth Social post if “all aircraft” refers to just planes or also helicopters. Canada is a major supplier of civilian helicopters, including medical evacuation helicopters used to move critically ill and injured patients.

Why Minnesota’s CEOs finally broke their silence,"Corporate giants in the Twin Cities stayed silent, publicly, for more than a month as massive federal immigration operations upended daily life and the local economy. Top Minnesota CEOs and business leaders had held phone calls about how to respond. Instead of going public, they settled on working behind the scenes to warn Trump administration officials and Republican leaders about economic damage from the surge of immigration agents to Minneapolis, say people close to the companies. The people spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Potential retribution from the administration and backlash from conservative customers and employees supportive of its mass deportation agenda stopped these companies from airing their concerns publicly of shifting policies, say people close to the decisions. Alex Pretti’s killing last week and growing national anger over the Trump administration’s immigration policies led companies to change course and make a public statement. The response said very little, but the fact that they spoke out at all spoke volumes about the severity of the situation in Minneapolis. Target, UnitedHealth, Best Buy, Cargill and dozens of other Minnesota-based companies issued a jointstatementlast Sunday calling for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” and for “state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.” “The recent challenges facing our state have created widespread disruption and tragic loss of life,” said the statement, released by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. Some Minnesota Democratscriticizedthe companies’ statement for failing to mention immigration, condemn the shooting of Pretti or Renee Good — another US citizen who was killed by a federal agent — or urge the administration to remove immigration officers from the Twin Cities. “It is far from sufficient. The clear way to de-escalate is for ICE to leave,” Minnesota State Rep. Michael Howardsaidon Facebook. “But I believe it’s a helpful step, albeit a small one.” Border czar Tom Homan announced Thursday he had ordered federal immigration authorities to workon a drawdown planin Minneapolis. A joint statement from Minnesota companies had been in the works prior to Pretti’s killing last week, but discussions accelerated immediately afterward, a person familiar with the letter said. Target’s incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke last Monday alsoacknowledgedthe “incredibly painful” violence in Minneapolis in a video message to employees. He offered resources and support to staff. Minnesota companies had resisted publicly denouncing immigration operations in recent weeks. Although customers staged protests at Target and other local stores, immigration officers arrested employees,and small businesses organized a citywide general strike, major companies deemed it too risky to speak out. Many companies, including Target, have been burned in recent years by taking and later reversing positions on social issues. Businesses are wary of a repeat. These companies, with operations around the United States and internationally, also monitor local and national sentiment closely. They judged that widespread anger over the crackdown in the Twin Cities had not spread nationally. The decision to speak up and the companies’ guarded language reflect how they are trying to stay in step with broad public sentiment, without antagonizing the administration. Polling on immigration operations hasworsenedin recent weeks and some Republican lawmakers in Minnesota and nationwide have started todistance themselvesfrom the crackdown in the state – signs the unease has spread. President Trump has also shifted his message, declining to say whether the officer who killed Pretti acted appropriately and said the administration was reviewing the incident. Staying quiet on a key economic issue like immigration represents a reversal in the public relations strategies of a once vocal group of corporate giants. Seventeen Fortune 500 companies are based in the Twin Cities, more per capita than any other US metro and in the top 10 globally. Business leaders call the region a“headquarters economy,”driven by a well-educated workforce of scientists, engineers, marketers and health professionals. The Twin Cities’ long tradition as a welcoming place for refugees and immigrants dating back to theVietnam Waralso helped make it a business-friendly hub. “The success of Minnesota’s economy, both now and in the future, is intrinsically linked to our immigrant communities,” Minnesota’s Chamber of Commercesaidin 2021. “Minnesota needs immigrant entrepreneurs and workers. They embody the spirit of our homegrown economy.” It’s also a noticeable contrast from how these companies responded to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in in 2020. After the murder, companies in Minnesota responded with public statements within days, built up internal corporate DEI teams, and pledged major investments to scholarship and workforce programs to expand diversity. Target, for example, invested billions of dollars in Black-owned vendors, opened stores in minority neighborhoods, and stocked shelves with LBGT-themed merchandise for Pride Month. Just a few years later, however, many companies scrapped their policies because of opposition from the Trump administration, right-wing activists on social media and lawsuits from conservative legal groups. “As a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future,” Target said last year. So Target and many businesses in the Twin Cities – and throughout America – went quiet. They’ve found very few reasons to stick their necks out, even tepidly.",2026-01-26T21:11:32.158Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/business/minnesota-companies-ceos-target,Nathaniel Meyersohn,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26025058364962-20260126200044697.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:22:24
Trump nominates inflation hawk Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair,"President Donald Trump said Fridayhe is nominating Kevin Warshto be the 17th chair of the Federal Reserve after Jerome Powell’s term ends in May. “I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Kevin Warsh to be the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, Trump wrote on his social media platform on Friday morning. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best.” In an Oval Office meeting later Friday, Trump further touted his pick, saying: “I would say that this was the perfect candidate. This was the man that’s most qualified, top student, best schools, everything was perfect, the youngest person ever to serve on the Fed. Got the whole package. Looks don’t mean anything, but he’s got the look, right?” Warsh is a somewhat conventional candidate for Fed chair:a former Fed governorwho was previously under consideration to be Treasury secretary in Trump’s second term and was a candidate for the top job at the Fed during Trump’s first term. Warsh was appointed to the Fed in 2006 at the age of 35, making him the youngest person to have ever served on the Fed’s powerful board. Warsh, now 55, has recently shifted his stance on monetary policy. A former inflation hawk, Warsh now favors lower interest rates, according to numerous public statements he’s made in recent months as Trump launched areality-show-like spectaclefor his Fed chair decision. He’s also called for overhauling the central bank’s workforce. “It’s reasonable to assume that he told the President he favors reducing interest rates today, otherwise he would not have been nominated,” wrote Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in commentary issued Friday. “Our instincts tell us Mr. Warsh will be more preoccupied with how history will view his record than with continuing to pander to the President.” Selecting a new Fed chair is one of the most important hires any president makes – but the nomination takes on even greater importance under this president. Trump has vowed to drive down the cost of living, and the Fed is responsible for maintaining price stability. Trump has railed against the Fed and Powell for the past year, berating Powell, his handpicked Fed chair, for not cutting rates. Earlier this month, Powell revealed in an extraordinary video statement that the Trump administration has launched a criminal investigation into the Fed and its chair. In hisextraordinary rebuke, Powell said the move was a “pretext” to intimidate the central bank to lower rates to the president’s liking. It’s been no secret that Trump has been unhappy with Powell, though it’s not clear he has the authority to actually fire him. However, Trumpwaved a termination letterin front of a group of House Republicans at an Oval Office meeting in August, according to three people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is actively arguing before the Supreme Court why it should proceed with removing Fed Governor Lisa Cook, whom the president said he fired in August. The Fed’s independence is at stake in the landmark case, but conservative Justices were already skeptical about the administration’s legal reasoningin oral arguments earlier this month. Trump names his pick to replace Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve Trump’s choice for central bank head caps off an extensive search process that at one point considered about a dozen people, from MAGA fixtures such asNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassettto even former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, according to Scott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury chief, who led the search. Bessent himself was also under consideration for the role but told Trump he’d prefer to remain in his current position. In addition to Warsh, the final four candidates were National Economic Council DirectorKevin Hassett, Fed GovernorChristopher Wallerand BlackRock’sRick Rieder. “Christopher Waller, Rick Rieder, and others, were interviewed for the Fed position. They all would have been outstanding, and have a great and unlimited future with “TRUMP.” Such amazing talent in our Country. Thank you!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday. Hassett would have been “a great Chairman,” Trump noted in a separate post. “But, quite honestly, he is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn’t want to let him go. Kevin is indescribably good so, as the expression goes, ‘if you can’t do better, don’t try to fix it!’” The Senate Banking Committee will consider Warsh’s nomination through a public hearing, then the broader Senate chamber will vote on whether or not to confirm him. But even that process may be tainted by the Trump administration’sextraordinary criminal investigation of Powell, a red line that some key Republican senators said Trump crossed that could hold up Warsh’s nomination until the investigation draws to a close. “No Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination until Trump drops his witch hunts of the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve and Governor Lisa Cook,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic member of the committee, said in a statement Friday. Trump’s efforts to politicize the Fed’s decisions have threatened to undermine the central bank’s prized independence. Members of the Senate Banking Committee will almost certainly ask Warsh about his shifting policy on interest rates and any potential promises he made to Trump about setting policy. He may also get questions about his father-in-law, Republican mega-donor Ronald Lauder. In 2002, Warsh married cosmetics billionaire heiress and businesswoman Jane Lauder, granddaughter of Estée Lauder. They met at Stanford. Jerome Powell’s remarkable advice to his successor speaks volumes about his battle with Trump Warsh worked as a White House economist in the George W. Bush administration. He is currently a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative-leaning think tank at Stanford University. Although Trump is seeking deep interest rate cuts to turbo-charge US growth, some economists and analysts note that Warsh once had a track record of pushing back against policies that stimulate the economy. For instance, in April 2009 during the middle of the Great Recession when the unemployment rate was surging, Warsh expressed concern about inflation. “I continue to be more worried about upside risks to inflation than downside risks,” Warsh said during a Fed meeting, according tominutesthat were later released. His own reason for resigning from the Fed in 2011 also underscores his aversion to loose monetary policy — at least before he was in the running for Fed chair this time around. “Kevin Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career and most importantly, during a time when the labor markets fell out of bed. His dovishness today stems from convenience,” analysts at Renaissance Macro Research posted on X Friday. “The President risks getting duped.” Warsh is seen in economic and financial circles as an experienced and serious policy figure with a deep resume. As a young Fed governor, he played a key role managing the financial crisis alongside then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and former New York Fed President Timothy Geithner, who later became Treasury secretary. However, he has shown he can be independent in the past: He stepped away from the central bank due to policy disagreements about the crisis-management tools the Fed used after the Great Financial Crisis. He was critical of quantitative easing, or large purchases of Treasury bonds to help lower long-term interest rates, saying later that such moves risked pushing up inflation and brought the Fed outside its core mandate. “He got the policy response wrong in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis,” Joe Brusuelas told CNN on Thursday. “He truly did not understand the nature, magnitude and implications of the Depression-like shock that occurred.” “During the defining crisis of our time – the Great Financial Crisis – Kevin Warsh continued to extoll inflation as the primary risk during 2007-08 as a massively deflationary event was unleashed via the near collapse of the American banking sector and freezing up of credit markets that ensued.”",2026-01-30T11:56:53.759Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/30/economy/kevin-warsh-nominated-fed-chair,"Bryan Mena, Matt Egan",business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2211325844-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:22:37
Velvet-rope security lines and grandpa’s heirlooms: Inside the rush to sell gold and silver,"In San Francisco, Seth Chandler’s business has lines out the door. It’s not unusual for twenty-odd people to be penned in by a velvet rope, monitored by two security guards. Chandler doesn’t own ahot new club or restaurant. He runs Witter Coin, which buys and sells precious metals — andpeople have been showing up in droves to sell their gold and silver. “I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s creating a lot of frenzy,” said Chandler who’s owned Witter Coin since 2016. “We’re buying and selling a lot.” The price of both metals has never been so high. Gold has doubled over the last year,crossing a record$5,000 an ounce for the first time this week. Theprice of silvertripled in that time. And as affordability remains challenging,everyday Americans, are cashing in where they can. Pawn and coin shop owners across the country tell CNN that more people than ever before are coming to sell gold or silver bars, bullions, silverware or broken jewelry. “We’re getting four to five times more people in our showroom than two years ago. It’s probably doubled the last six months with precious metals prices going through the roof,” said Chandler, who has doubled his staff to accommodate the demand. Gold and silver are considered “safe havens,” meaning assets where investors move their money when Wall Street gets nervous about the overall US economy — often because of macro issues and geopolitical tensions. So, when President Donald Trump threatens toacquire Greenlandor raise tariffs onCanadaorSouth Korea, the price of both metals rises. It’s “the belief or the hope that if you have major correction in the stock market or if you have suddenly inflation reemerging or accelerating, that gold and silver will be able to maintain its value,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, told CNN. High prices make selling gold or silver attractive, but it’s also good for the buyer. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America project gold could rise to $5,400 to $6,000 an ounce by the end of this year. Witter Coin, which also buys collectible coins, watches and jewelry, has occasionally brought in $1 million worth of metal in a single transaction,Chandler said. But with prices so high, it’s become more valuable for the shop to send the raw metal from those items to a refinery rather than resell it. “It broke my heart that we had a fascinatingly beautiful 18-karat gold pocket watch that was handmade in the 1880s. You’re talking 145 years old, probably took a couple of people a few weeks to make it all by hand, 180 different parts,” said Chandler. “And guess what? We had to disassemble it and melt the gold.” Kelly Swisher, the owner of Arlington Jewelry and Pawn in Arlington Heights, Illinois, said the currentprecious metal crazehas him buying tens of thousands of dollars’ worth each week. While gold has seen a steady rise for years, he’s surprised how much silver has caught fire. “I just had a big set (of silverware) come in and I ended up giving them $6,000,” said Swisher, who opened his shop in 2002. “I’m like, this is just insanity. A year ago, it would’ve been $2,800 or $2,700.” Silver prices surged 141% in 2025, the best performance since 1979, and they’re already up 32% this year. Beyond the metal’s safe haven status, prices are also being pushed higher because of strong industrial demand and lingering supply deficits. “We would see a couple people a week come in with silver (a month ago), and right now we’re probably seeing a dozen or more people every day coming in with some sort of silver product,” said Seth Gold, vice president of American Jewelry and Loan in Detroit, Michigan. Gold and silver are so hot that people aren’t just hauling in the family’s sterling silver set or gold bars from Costco. Customers are also digging through the drawers for scrap gold and unwanted or broken jewelry. For Americans struggling for basic cost of living, the sale has proven both lucrative and life-changing. “In this economy, if somebody’s coming in expecting to get a couple hundred dollars for this scrap gold and you tell them it’s $850, they all of a sudden just are overwhelmed,” said Swisher. “They can’t imagine that that little bag of junk that they had in their drawer is worth that much money.

Trump expected to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair,"President Donald Trump is expected to announce Friday his intentto nominate Kevin Warshto be the next Federal Reserve chair, according to two people involved in the process. Trump, who has been weighing the decision for several months and had narrowed down the list of candidates to four in recent weeks, told reporters on Thursday night he had finalized his pick and would formallymake the announcement on Friday. “I’m going to be announcing, I think, a really great choice tomorrow,” Trump said while arriving at the premiere of first lady Melania Trump’s documentary. Trump did not name his selection. Warsh met with Trump at the White House on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter, and administration officials have been preparing since for the former Fed governor to be Trump’s nominee. The White House and Warsh didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump declined to publicly name his choice, and administration officials cautioned that nothing was final until announced by Trump directly. Several officials noted that Trump has shifted his view on the best candidate several times over the course of the process. Jerome Powell’s remarkable advice to his successor speaks volumes about his battle with Trump But Trump appeared set in his decision on Thursday night, and the preparations for a White House announcement were underway, the people said. “It’s going to be somebody that is very respected, somebody that’s known to everybody in the financial world,” Trump said. “And I think it’s going to be a very good choice.” Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett,BlackRock executive Rick Riederand Fed Governor Christopher Waller were the final four candidates under consideration.  Trump held in-person interviews with each of the final four candidates as the final stage of a process that concluded earlier this month. Warsh has long been mentioned by Trump as one of his top candidates for the role and met with Trump in December for his formal interview. The sit-down was viewed positively by Trump’s advisors, and Trump told associates that he thought Warsh did well. He also made clear that Warsh, according to one person who spoke to him about the meeting, “looked the part.” Warsh served as a Fed governor for five years after being nominated by President George W. Bush. He’s been considered for top economic roles in the first and second Trump administrations and was viewed as a possible Treasury secretary pick before Trump tapped Scott Bessent. Warsh was also considered by Trump in 2017 for the Fed chair role, which ultimately went to Jerome Powell. “A lot of people think that this is somebody that could have been there a few years ago,” Trump told reporters Thursday night. Trump quickly soured on Powell in his first term andhas attacked and criticized the chairand the Fed relentlessly throughout the first year of his second term.",2026-01-30T04:54:25.533Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/business/trump-expected-nominate-kevin-warsh-fed-chair,Phil Mattingly,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2211325619.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:23:17
"Gold just hit a record $5,000. What’s driving the surge?","Gold prices surged beyond $5,000 per ounce for the first time late Sunday, as investors rushed to the safe-haven asset as concern spread that US President Donald Trump is upending relations with key allies, from Europe to Canada. In this year’s first 26 days, the price of gold has jumped 15%; a historic rally that builds on arecord-breaking year in 2025, when prices skyrocketed 65% – the largest annual gain since 1979. Gold is often seen as a refuge in uncertain times and a barometer of market anxiety. And this latest surge has been driven by a series of market-destabilizing global and domestic moves by Trump –– from thenow-revoked tariff threats against NATO alliesover Greenland, to the military operation against Venezuela, and thecriminal investigationinto Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Demand has also been driven by a weaker US dollar, higher-than-expected inflation, predictions the Fed will further cut interest rates this year, and the purchase of the precious metal by central banks around the world. Gold was up 1.4% Sunday to $5,058 a troy ounce, as of 8:14 pm ET. Silver, another safe-haven asset surging in value, rose 4.5% to $107.8 an ounce Sunday. Like Gold, Silver last year also recorded its best performance since 1979, with a 141% price increase. Despite hitting the $5,000 benchmark, analysts remained largely bullish on gold, arguing prices could rise further as uncertainty persists. Before the record rally, Goldman Sachs analysts had raised their forecasts of gold prices to $5,400 per troy ounce, citing private sector investors’ interests in the yellow metal due to “lingering global policy uncertainty,” according to a research note published by the investment bank last week. Others saw even more room for gains. Bank of America’s chief investment officer Michael Hartnett said in a research note last week that gold prices could peak above $6,000. Less than one month into 2026, Trump’s policy whiplash has fueled geopolitical uncertainty and rattled markets, pushing investors to bet on precious metals. Gold prices jumped following the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s threat against the Iranian regime amid a bloody crackdown on protesters. Trump also ramped up his rhetoric about annexing Greenland and threatened to reigniting a global trade war with tariffs on European allies that opposed his plans of acquiring the Danish territory. Even though Trump abruptly backed down and claimed a deal was reached on Wednesday, markets remained unsettled by the White House’s unpredictability. Then on Saturday, Trumpthreatened to slap 100% tariffs on Canadian importsshould the US neighbor make a trade deal with China – something Ottawa has said it has “no intention” of doing. Domestically, the US President has also renewed attacks on Powell, the Fed chair. Federal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into him earlier this month, throwing into question the political independence of the central bank. Together, these developments have unnerved investors, accelerating a flight into precious metals.",2026-01-26T02:19:23.312Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/25/business/gold-record-trump-global-concerns-intl-hnk,John Liu,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2257132036.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:23:30
