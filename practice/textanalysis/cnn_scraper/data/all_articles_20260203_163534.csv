CNN’s guide to the most important elections of 2026,"This year’s midterms will not only shape the final two years of Donald Trump’s presidency; they’ll determine what politics after Trump might start to look like. A series of races that starts with primaries on March 3 will either preserve Republican majorities in Congress, helping Trump to push through his agenda, or give Democrats control of either the US House or Senate and the ability to stop his legislative priorities and open investigations into him. Along the way, candidates and party leaders will dissect the results as they prepare for the 2028 presidential race, which will be the first national election in 16 years without Trump’s name on the ballot. Here are the key dates and contests they – and we – will be watching over the course of the next year: Texas is home to blockbuster Senate primaries on both sides that will tee up one of the year’s most high-profile contests – a race that is poised to offer clues about the types of candidates voters are looking to lead their parties – where tone and tactics might shape the outcomes more than policy proposals or ideology. Incumbent GOP Sen. John Cornyn is beingchallengedby state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. The Democratic contest featuresRep. Jasmine Crockettandstate Rep. James Talarico. Democrats will also choose a nominee for governor to run against incumbent GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, who is seeking a fourth term. There’s seemingly less drama in the outcome of the Senate primaries in North Carolina, where formerDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooperandformer RNC chair Michael Whatleyappear headed toward a key general election clash. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin’sretirementhas sparked a crowded field of Democrats seeking to replace the veteran lawmaker. Among the top contenders: Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, who is backed by Gov. JB Pritzker, and a pair of Chicago-area House members, Reps. Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi. The Ohio Senate race is effectively set, with GOP Sen. Jon Husted and former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown on a collision course for the November general election. Ohio has shifted from a perennial battleground to a reliably red state, but Brown is key toDemocrats’ hopesof flipping the Senate. The Buckeye State also has an open contest for governor with GOP Gov. Mike DeWine ineligible to run again because of term limits. On the Republican side, former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is the favorite while former Ohio health director Amy Acton is the top Democratic contender. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy is facing a challenge from Rep. Julia Letlow, wholaunched a primary bidin January after receiving Trump’s endorsement. Cassidy has largely supported the president’s second-term agenda but has voiced concerns about the administration’s moves on vaccines and was one of seven GOP senators who voted to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial in 2021 following the attack on the US Capitol. Other Republicans running include State Treasurer John Fleming and state Sen. Blake Miguez. Louisiana’s switch to a partisan primary system could also be a factor. If no candidate receives a majority of the primary vote, the top two finishers would advance to a June runoff. Georgia Republicans will pick a Senate nominee to challengeJon Ossoff, the lone Senate Democrat seeking reelection this year in a state Trump won in 2024. A contest that will offer clues about the GOP’s future direction features Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins as well as former college football coach Derek Dooley, who is endorsed by Gov. Brian Kemp. Both parties also have gubernatorial primaries in the race to succeed Kemp, who is term-limited. The Republican field includes Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state who resisted Trump’s pressure campaign to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia, and Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who served as afake elector seeking to falsely certify Trumpas the winner that year. Trump has endorsed Jones. Democratic contenders include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former GOP Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and former state Sen. Jason Esteves. Loyalty to Donald Trump andthe legacy of Mitch McConnellare the political forces that have shaped the Republican Senate primary in Kentucky, where Rep. Andy Barr, former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron and businessman Nate Morris all have ties to the retiring GOP senator but have instead touted their pro-Trump credentials. These candidates all interned for Mitch McConnell. Now they’re attacking each other for associating with him Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie will also face Trump-backed primary challenger Ed Gallrein. The president’s allies have made it a priority to knock out Massie as he’s become a thorn in Trump’s side on several issues, notably overthe release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. There’s a crowded field to replace California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Democratic candidates include former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, former Rep. Katie Porter, billionaire and climate activist Tom Steyer, Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. On the Republican side are Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative media personality Steve Hilton. Under California’s primary system, all candidates run on the same primary ballot and the top two, regardless of party, advance to the general election. Iowa could offer clues about whether Democrats are able tomake inroadsin more rural states. Democrat Rob Sand, the state auditor, is seeking to succeed outgoing GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds. The Republican field includes Rep. Randy Feenstra and farmer Zach Lahn. The state also has an open Senate contest following GOP Sen. Joni Ernst’s decision not to seek reelection, with Rep. Ashley Hinson the favorite on the Republican side and a full field of Democratic contenders that includes state Sen. Zach Wahls; state Rep. Josh Turek, a two-time Paralympic gold medalist in wheelchair basketball; and Marine Corps veteran Nathan Sage. Democrats are hoping that 2026 is the year they finally defeat Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins, who has a proven track record of outperforming her party in the blue-leaning state. The question facing Democrats this year is whether Gov. Janet Mills, the favorite of the party establishment, or progressive Graham Platner, an oyster farmer and combat veteran, represent the best chance of accomplishing that goal. Some in the party worry Platner’s past controversial social mediapostscould jeopardize the party’s chances against Collins, while others on the left see Mills – who would be the oldest freshman senator ever elected – as unlikely to excite base voters. In South Carolina, the GOP primary for governor will be closely watched as a gauge of the mood of Republican voters in a key early state ahead of the 2028 nominating process. Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, state Attorney General Alan Wilson and Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman are among the contenders to succeed Gov. Henry McMaster. Rep. Elise Stefanik’sdecisionto end her gubernatorial bid left Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman as the sole major Republican vying to challenge Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is facing a primary from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado. The star power in the Empire State may be in the 12th Congressional District, where a wide field is seeking to succeed longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler. The Democratic primary includes state assembly members Alex Bores and Micah Lasher, longtime Republican lawyer turned Trump critic George Conway and Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of former President John F. Kennedy. Michigan is a state that has it all. There is an open race for governor that features rising stars in both parties: Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on the Democratic side and Rep. John James on the Republican side. A potential wildcard in the race is Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who left the Democratic Party to run as an independent. Democratic Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist ended his bid for governor in January and launched a run for secretary of state. With Democrat Gary Peters retiring, the state also has an open Senate race that Democrats must hold if they stand a chance of winning the majority. The top contenders in that primary are Rep. Haley Stevens, seen as the favorite of the party establishment, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, and Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive who is a former executive director of the Detroit Health Department. Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, who lost a 2024 bid for Senate against Democrat Elissa Slotkin, is running again. In Arizona, there is a crowded GOP primary for governor battling to challenge Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs in a crucial battleground state. Trump has endorsed both business executive Karrin Taylor Robson and Rep. Andy Biggs – while Rep. David Schweikert has also launched a bid, opening up a key House seat. This day will serve up two big tests of the Democratic Party’s direction with an ideological clash in the Minnesota Senate race and a wide-open contest for governor in Wisconsin. In Minnesota, moderate Rep. Angie Craig and progressive Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan are facing off for the Democratic nomination and the chance to succeed retiring Sen. Tina Smith. The GOP field includesformer sportscaster Michele Tafoya. The state will also host an open race for governor after Democrat Tim Walz’s decision not to seek reelection to a third term. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar launched a bid in January, pledging to unify the state as it finds itself at the center of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. GOP contenders include state House Speaker Lisa Demuth and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. Sen. Amy Klobuchar launches bid for Minnesota governor: ‘We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is’ In Wisconsin, the decision by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to not seek reelection has drawn a large field of contenders that includes former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who narrowly lost a 2022 Senate bid, current Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez ",2026-01-09T10:00:59.653Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/09/politics/2026-election-calendar,Terence Burlij,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/primary-calendar-hp-art-largetease.png?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:19:24
Sheriff believes Savannah Guthrie’s mother was abducted: ‘She did not leave on her own’,"The mother of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie is still missingMonday night after being taken from her Arizona home more than a day earlier, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos, who said the investigation into her alleged abduction is ongoing. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen Saturday around 9:30 p.m. near her home, where she lives alone in the Catalina Foothills area near Tucson, the sheriff said. When asked whether Guthrie was kidnapped, Nanos told CNN’s Erin Burnett, “I’ve been doing this for 50 years. I have a gut feeling.” Evidence found at the scene also indicates Guthrie was removed from her home in the middle of the night against her will, said Nanos, who did not provide more details about the case. The sheriff also declined to comment on whether any evidence indicates Guthrie was hurt, saying, “I just can’t really speak to that right now.” “We also believe she was taken from her bed but cannot speak as to why,” Nanos told CNN in an email Monday. Officials do not know what time Guthrie may have been taken, Nanos added. Guthrie has mobility issues and is without daily medication that is critical to maintaining her health, according to Nanos. “The family has told us 24 hours without those meds could be fatal, and here we are at 30 plus hours,” Nanos said Monday night. “This is not dementia-related. She is as sharp as a tack,” Nanos said Monday. “The family wants everybody to know this isn’t somebody who just wandered off.” When Guthrie did not show up to church Sunday morning, a church member called her family, who went to her home around 11 a.m. to look for her, the sheriff said. A family member called 911 around noon Sunday to report her missing, Nanos said. Homicide detectives were sent to Guthrie’s home, in a non-standard move, according to Nanos. And what detectives found at the scene was “very concerning,” the sheriff said. “We believe now, after we’ve processed that crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime scene — that we do in fact have a crime,” Nanos said during a news conference Monday. No additional updates are expected Monday, according to the sheriff’s department. Authorities have Guthrie’s cell phone, said Nanos, and havedescribed the circumstances as suspicious. Nanos says authorities have received a lot of leads but “nothing specific” to the investigation. Downloading security camera footage from the home is now the main priority for investigators, Nanos told CNN. Private companies such as Google and Apple have also offered their assistance, Nanos added. An up-to-$2,500 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of a person or people involved in the disappearance, according to a poster by the 88-Crime nonprofit organization,sharedby the sheriff’s department late Monday. The sheriff’s office has also set up a tip line, urging the public to share information with investigators, and said it is seeking photos and videos that may help with the investigation. “Every detail matters. Even small tips could make a difference,” the department said in a Facebook post. While local law enforcement is leading the investigation, FBI agents from across Arizona are “fully engaged” and are offering numerous technical resources to local authorities, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Agents are assisting with analysis of data from cell phone towers near the Guthrie home, the source said, which is an FBI specialty often offered to support missing persons and fugitive cases. Local and federal authorities are canvassing nearby residences and businesses for any security camera footage that may assist in identifying a possible suspect, the source said. Search and rescue teams, including volunteers, dogs, border patrol agents and helicopters, were also dispatched. Police do not believe there is a threat to the public, Nanos said. “Everybody just wants to be able to know that they can go outside and enjoy their community and come home and be safe at night in their rooms, asleep in bed, and this lady wasn’t able to accomplish that,” Nanos said Monday. “We need her back. We need to find her, and time is very critical.” The “Today” show led with the news on Monday morning and shared a statement from Savannah Guthrie, who said, “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.” “We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department at 520-351-4900.” Guthrie reiterated her gratitude for the public’s support on Instagram late Monday. “Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy,” shewrote. She described her mother as “a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant,” and asked supporters to “raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment.” The “Today” anchor then quoted from the Bible: “He will keep in perfect peace those whose hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord,” ending her post with a solemn message: “Bring her home.” Savannah Guthrie,whose father died before her senior year of high school, has spoken highly of her mother and their close relationship. When the anchor was offered her first news job in Butte, Montana, at the age of 21, her mother encouraged her to pursue the role, despite the distance from home. “It’s not because she didn’t want me to stay. Of course she wanted me to stay,” the “Today” anchor recalled. “But she’s like, ‘I’m not going to stand in the way of your dreams.’” This story has been updated with additional information.

Venezuelan oil is key to Trump’s Russia plan. There’s a problem with that,"President Donald Trumpmade a bargainwith India this week thatintroduced a simple calculus. The reality isn’t that simple. Venezuela’s crude operation isn’t yet up to snuff, and India can’t easily turn its back on Russia. But it’s a start. Trump can still use Venezuela’s newlyopen-for-business oil industryto fight Russia on economic terms and limit its ability to continue its devastating war with Ukraine. India and China make up the vast majority of Russia’s oil sales. Western countries have sanctioned Russian oil since the start of the Ukraine war, so those Indian and Chinese oil purchases are crucial to help keep Russia’s economy afloat. Its heavy, sour crude is remarkably similar to Russia’s — it’s the thick, sludgy stuff that is perfect for making the fuel oil, diesel, asphalt and other derivatives that India’s booming economy needs. America’s light, sweet crude, by contrast, is great for making gasoline — but not much else. And India’s refineries are well-positioned to handle Venezuelan-type oil. After the United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3, Trump laid out the welcome mat for US oil companies to start drilling. The South American countrypassed legal reformslast week that could help bring back foreign oil companies to revitalize Venezuela’s dilapidated oil infrastructure. “It is definitely a step in the right direction, and it will help pave the way for higher investment in the country,” Homayoun Falakshahi, lead crude research analyst at Kpler, said about Venezuela’s just-passed oil industry reforms. But the good news pretty much ends there — at least for now. Venezuela has been producing only a hair over1 million barrels of oil per day, roughly two thirds of which gets shipped to its largest customer: China. Even if Venezuela sent 100% of its oil to India, it wouldn’t make up for the 1.5 million barrels of oil India imports from Russia each day. Venezuela has that potential: It’s sitting on the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Before former President Hugo Chavez’s socialist government came to power in 1999, the country was producing more than 3 million barrels of oil per day. But its infrastructure has long since crumbled, and it would take tens of billions of dollars each year over the course of a decade to get back to that production level, industry experts widely agree. That would take foreign investment and cooperation from major Western oil companies that have so farbeen hesitantto devote the resources needed to power Venezuela’s revival. Just after the United States ousted Maduro, America’s energy industry said that topersuade oil majors to return, Venezuela will need to establish the rule of law, ensure long-term political stability, a repeal of its nationalist oil laws and repay billions of dollars in debts. The United States would also need to repeal its sanctions and offer some form of financial guarantees. Only two of those things have happened so far: The Trump administration got rid of sanctions, and Venezuela revised its oil laws. Trump said debt repayments, security and financial guarantees would not be part of the bargain with oil companies that choose to go back to Venezuela. And despite the fact that Venezuela’s acting President Delcy Rodríguez is playing ball with Trump for now, there’s no chance Venezuela can guarantee its current government will continue to honor any deal struck with Western oil companies over the long haul. And US oil companies will still need to pay the country a hefty royalty on their oil production. That calls into question whether oil majors can get the same return on their investment there as in other countries — particularly when oil prices are so low — noted Rob Thummel, a senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. Although Trump said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to stop buying Russian oil, that can’t happen overnight. India would need to make big infrastructure upgrades, noted Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management. “The adjustment of the global supply distribution chain will take time, especially noting the transit time differences between Russian imports and Venezuelan imports for India,” Haworth said. India would also need to pay a hefty premium over the Russian Urals oil it’s buying now. Russian oil trades at a significant discount — roughly $16 a barrel — to OPEC or US crude, making it hard for India to quit. (Falling global oil prices have made that calculation a bit easier for India to accept.) But India has been flouting Western sanctions by buying Russian crude off ofshadow fleet vesselsfor years — and there are no signs it’s about to stop, even after reaching a deal with Trump, noted Robert Yawger at Mizuho Securities. “There’s been a zillion different ways they have been able to outflank sanction authorities,” Yawger said. Venezuelan oil adds a welcome X factor into the Russia equation that could one day change the status quo, at least somewhat. Russia has already been hurt by falling oil prices, and its economy is struggling because of global sanctions. High inflation and growing debt have made life even more difficult for Russians. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s economyisn’t all that close to collapsing. Russia has managed to expand through a combination of increased manufacturing, shadow oil fleets and higher taxes. Losing India as an oil customer is unlikely to deal a fatal blow. Still, weakening Russian oil sales could make a difference, even if India only gradually weans itself off Russian crude. “Over time, this may create additional challenges for the Russian economy,” said Haworth. That would make the war in Ukraine harder for Russia to fund. And in a war that haskilled nearly 2 million people, something is better than nothing.",2026-02-03T05:01:46.816Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/03/business/venezuela-oil-russia-india-trump-tariffs,David Goldman,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2257239059.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:19:45
Trump slashes tariffs on India after he says Modi agrees to stop buying Russian oil,"President Donald Trump on Monday announced he would reduce tariffs on Indian goods in exchange for, among other things, a promise tostop buying Russian oil. That will be a tall task: India has been importing roughly 1.5 million barrels of Russian oil each day — even months after Trump placed tariffs on Indian goods as punishment — according toKpler, a global trade data provider. Russian oil makes up more than a third of India’s overall imports. Trump said in a social media post that he spoke Monday morning with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who agreed to replace the country’s Russian crude imports with oil from Venezuela and the United States. Modi welcomed the reduced tariffs in aposton X, but he did not mention cutting purchases of Russian oil. Venezuelan oil is of the same quality as Russian oil — heavy, sour and perfect for making derivatives like fuel oil and diesel, which India’s refineries are already set up to process, noted Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. It’s not clear, however, how long that transition may take. Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is dilapidated and requires about a decade of work and tens of billions of investment dollars to return it to the more-than-3 million barrels a day output it had achieved before the country’s Socialist government took control in 1999. India also buys more oil from Russia than Venezuela produces. “Fully replacing Russian oil with oil from Venezuela or the US will take significant investment,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Asset Management. “But. over time, this may create additional challenges for the Russian economy.” India is a major purchaser of Russian oil, which has beensanctionedby most Western countries because of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war with Ukraine. China buys significantly more Russian oil than India — and unlike India, China hasn’t faced additional tariffs for purchasing Russian oil. Turkey is a distant third. Indian government officials have defended purchasing Russian oil previously, calling it essential to the country’s energy security. India is the world’s third-largest consumer of oil, and Russia is a close-by seller. India relies on its crude to support its fast-growing economy, fueled by the world’s largest population. And Russian oil has traded at a significant discount – roughly $16 a barrel – to OPEC or US crude, making it hard for India to quit, noted Robert Yawger at Mizuho Securities. Even after this agreement with the United States, Yawger said he expected India may flout sanctions and purchase Russian oil, as it has throughout the past several years. “There’s been a zillion different ways they have been able to outflank sanction authorities,” Yawger said. “They’ll find a way to go dark fleet and get those barrels moved.” (Dark fleets are ships that use murky tactics to transport oil for pariah states.) But as oil prices have come down over the past several months, the difference in price between sanctioned oil and non-sanctioned oil eroded, allowing India to make a change. “When oil prices were high, that was big. But with oil prices coming down, that advantage is not so substantial,” noted Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economic adviser for India’s government. “If you throw into the calculus that Indian exporters were suffering from Trump tariffs, it became easier to stop buying Russian oil.” US crude prices were down 5% to about $61 a barrel on Monday, but that was mostly unchanged from before Trump’s announcement. Oil fell sharply earlier in the day because traders were hopeful the United States would reach a deal with Iran without striking the crude-rich country. That could imply the oil market remains skeptical that the Indian deal means much at all. “India has been slow-walking these trade talks for months, and the terms here are so vague that they could be anything from major to nothingburger,” said Scott Lincicome, an economist at the Cato Institute. Trump said Indian goods would immediately face an 18% tariff, down from a 50% – a rate that had included an additional 25% tariff Trumpput in place in Augustto persuade India to stop purchasing Russian oil. A White House spokesperson told CNN that Trump will fully remove the additional tariff and reduce the so-called reciprocal tariff. Indian goods had among highest tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration. Because of various exemptions, the effective tariff rate on Indian goods was roughly 35%, according to Subramanian. Trump, calling Modi “one of my greatest friends,” also said India’s prime minister agreed to reduce India’s tariffs on US goods to zero, and to remove unspecified non-tariff barriers. Although Trump didn’t explain which barriers would be removed, those often include special taxes on US companies’ services or value-added taxes on goods. India also pledged to invest in American goods “at a much higher level” in addition to a $500 billion invesment in US energy, technology, agriculture and coal among other products, Trump said. Trump may have been eager to cut a deal with India after the European Union signed a long-soughtfree trade agreementwith India last week, noted Subramanian. “If India gives preferential access to the EU, US business is affected,” he said. “There has been a domino effect.” Although India isn’t one of America’s largest trading partners, the reduction in tariffs could nevertheless make a meaningful dent: The United States imported $95.5 billion in goods from India in 2025 as of November, 3% of the value of total imported goods, and it exported $42 billion of goods there over that time, according to the US Census Bureau. Among the top goods the US imported from India last year are computers and other electronics, such as phones, pharmaceuticals, apparel and chemicals. Jewelry prices in the United States have risen in recent months in part because of tariffs on India. Meanwhile, India’s top imports from the US were oil, gas, airplanes and airplane parts. Beyond goods, corporate America has grown increasingly reliant on India. Companies including American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and Google have deepened their footprint in India, hiring workers there rather than sponsoring visas to work in the US and even opened new offices there.

Savannah Guthrie was getting ready to cover the Olympics. Then came the ‘worst phone call of her life’,"Savannah Guthrie was supposed to fly to Italy on Monday for NBC’s much-anticipated coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics. But instead, Guthrie spent a heart-wrenching day in Tucson, Arizona, supporting a massive search for her 84-year-old mother, Nancy. The elder Guthrie’s disappearance became national news on Monday as authorities described her home as a “crime scene” and asked the public for help finding her. NBC mobilized its considerable resources to help one of the network’s biggest and best-loved stars. Guthrie’s co-hosts on the “Today” show shared the Pima County Sheriff’s Department’s tip line phone number, 520-351-4900, all across television and social media. This story “hits too close to home for our newsroom,” anchor Tom Llamas said Monday night, leading “NBC Nightly News” with the missing person case. “The sheriff there tells me she was taken against her will from her bed in the middle of the night,” Llamas reported. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Savannah and her family right now.” Guthrie, a 19-year veteran of NBC, joined the “Today” show cast in 2011 and was promoted to one of the main co-host chairs just one year later. Over the years she has added other roles, including co-hosting NBC’s coverage of the Olympics opening ceremonies, which she was scheduled to host again this Friday at the San Siro Stadium in Milan, alongside sports commentator Terry Gannon. Guthrie was also slated to anchor NBC’s first night of prime time Olympics coverage because the usual anchor, Mike Tirico, will be in California for the Super Bowl. With that big international trip coming up, Guthrie spent much of last weekend with her husband and two kids. But her plans were shattered when a family member called her and said Nancy was missing. It was “the worst phone call of her life,” said an NBC producer who knows Savannah personally. Authorities in Pima County, Arizona, said Nancy’s family members searched her home in vain before calling 911 to report her missing around noon local time on Sunday. A source familiar with the matter said Savannah immediately scrambled to fly to Tucson. On Monday morning, Pima County sheriff Chris Nanos said Savannah had been in touch with his office, and “she has a security team that’s been in touch with us throughout the night.” The NBC host called herself a “daughter of the desert” in a “Today” show segment about her Tucson roots last fall. In the segment, Savannah and Nancy dined together at a local restaurant — one of many times the host featured her mom on the morning show. Nancy called Tucson “wonderful” during the segment: “Just the air, the quality of life is laid back and gentle.” “I like to watch the javelinas eat my plants,” she added with a laugh, referring to pig-looking animals that are often seen in the area. Savannah’s family history is well known to “Today” show fans. Nancy and her husband Charles lived in Australia, where Charles worked as a mining engineer, when Savannah was born in 1971. The family relocated to Arizona when Savannah was young. Charles died of a heart attack when she was starting senior year of high school. “We lost my dad suddenly and shockingly,” Savannah recalled in a 2023 interview. “And my mom was so strong, and set aside her own grief in many ways, just to be there and make sure we could all move forward together.” On Monday, Savannah issued a statement on behalf of her family, thanking law enforcement and saying “our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.” The “Today” show typically relocates to the site of the Olympics for a long stretch of the games. It almost goes without saying that Savannah’s Olympics plans are on hold. An NBC spokesperson had no comment on any changes, but a source familiar with the matter said Guthrie will not host the opening ceremony telecast. Anchors and reporters across the network shared prayers for the Guthries on Monday. Llamas ended Monday’s “Nightly News” by saying, “Tonight, we’re asking for your help” to find the elder Guthrie. “If you know Savannah then you know her mom — because she raised her, through some very tough times,” Llamas said. “Savannah has shared that it was her mother who taught her the power of prayer, the types of prayers that make you get on your knees and pray for God’s protection. Savannah and her family need your prayers tonight. They also need your help.” “Savannah,” Llamas said, “we know how strong you are, we are praying, and we won’t stop until you find her.”",2026-02-03T01:43:01.418Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/media/savannah-nancy-guthrie-missing-olympics,Brian Stelter,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2205084291.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:03
"Elon Musk’s SpaceX acquires xAI, merging his two most ambitious companies","SpaceX has acquiredxAI, the company announced on Monday, merging two of Elon Musk’s most ambitious companies into the most valuable private company in the world. “This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI’s mission,” Musk said ina statementon SpaceX’s website. The merger could be seen as an indication of the cash xAI needs to compete in the fast-growing field of AI, as well as the technology’s importance in future of space exploration. SpaceX was valued at $800 billion as of a secondary share sale in December 2025, and xAI was valued at $230 billion as of their most recent funding round in January, according to PitchBook, a research firm that tracks the valuation of private companies. The movealso shows the scramble tech giants like Musk’s companies are going through to secure more computing resources to power artificial intelligence advancements. “Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial data centers, which require immense amounts of power and cooling,” Musk wrote. “The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space.” SpaceX sought permission on Friday from the Federal Communication Commission to launch a constellation of 1 million satellites into orbit. The filing said the aim is to provide a network of solar-powered data centers to “accommodate the explosive growth of data demands driven by AI.” Musk said he estimates that the “lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space” within two to three years. Musk is the latest tech leader to call for more computing power in the age of AI. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangtold CNBClast year that next-generation AI models will require “100 times” more power than older models. AI is expected to spike data center power demand by 165% by 2030, according toGoldman Sachs. And tech giants have been pouring billions into AI-related infrastructure to meet that demand. Microsoft last week reported it spent $37.5 billion in the last quarter of 2025 on capital expenditures like data centers, while Meta spent $22.14 billion. At the same time, some US residents have reported seeing their electricity bills surge. ABloomberg News analysislast year found that in areas near data centers, electricity costs rose as much as 267% compared to five years ago. But higher electric bills isn’t the only concern about the technology. Musk’s xAI alsoowns his social media platform X,whose chatbot Grok recently came under fire for producingsexual imagesof mainly women, many of them real people. The AI chatbot was also criticized last year for a series ofviolent and antisemitic posts, which the company apologized for and blamed on a systems update. Investors are lining up to pour cash into AI anyway. ﻿In January, xAIannouncedit raised $20 billion dollars from investors, including from Fidelity Management & Research Company and the Qatar Investment Authority. There was already plenty of crossover between xAI and SpaceX well before the acquisition. Several employees worked at both companies, such as Christopher Stanley, a principal security engineer for SpaceX since 2018 who has been X’s senior director of security engineering since 2022. But some people who have worked at xAI have publicly expressed concern that the two companies are set up for a culture clash. “xAI prides itself on ‘move fast and break things,’ flat hierarchy, act first ask questions later. (It isn’t fully this, but tries to be) I have a hunch many xAI people will hit culture shock w/ SpaceX,”wroteBenjamin De Kraker, a former staffer on xAI’s human data team. Musk confirmed in December he was planning aninitial public offeringfor SpaceX, which was founded in 2002. That Wall Street debut, reportedly valued at about $1.5 trillion, could be one of the largest in history. And that was before the merger with xAI. Both SpaceX and xAI have had no trouble raising money from investors eager to participate in their growth plans. But being publicly traded would increase the ability of the companies to raise capital. That proposition that could add to Musk’s already staggering net worth. He’s worth $676 billion, according to Bloomberg’s real time Billionaire tracker, making him the richest person in the world. A combined SpaceX and xAI public could dramatically increase that net worth.

It’s been a weird few days on Wall Street,"Wall Street traders are grappling with sharp swings in precious metals, bitcoin is hovering at its lowest level since April and there are lingering nerves about technology stocks. It’s been a weird few days on Wall Street. Gold and silver, considered havens amid uncertainty, have experienced enormous volatility. Aferocious rallyin precious metals this year halted with apainful dropon Friday. Meanwhile, bitcoin slumped over the weekend, tumbling from above $83,000 to as low as $74,570 and hitting its lowest level since April. Bitcoin is down sharply from a record high above $126,000 in October. Andmarkets in Asiakicked off February on a down note: South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index sank 5.26% on Monday and had its worst day since April. Thehottest trades on Wall Streetacross the past year — from precious metals to South Korean tech companies — are experiencing turbulence after enormous gains. Gold surged to a record high above $5,550 a troy ounce on Wednesday before dropping 11% on Friday. Silver plunged 31%. Gold early Monday dropped as low as $4,423 before paring losses and trading around $4,680 as of the afternoon. Wall Street in recent years has experienced instances of so-calledmeme stock mania, where traders rally around a specific company to try and ride a surge in its share price. Some investors say similar themes of exuberance have developed around precious metals as they have become increasingly popular investments. “More recently, some serious froth and leverage entered this asset class…as its continued rally got the attention of individual investors and momentum-based investors alike,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, said in a note. “The recent run up in precious metals feels to have an enormous speculative element,” Jim Reid, global head of macro research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. “While a correction had been increasingly anticipated — and was arguably overdue — the speed and depth of the sell-off proved a stark wake-up call,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note. Hansen said the rally in precious metals and particularly silver — supported by strong demand from Chinese investors — had also been “increasingly driven by FOMO and speculative excess.” “When gold and silver turn into hot topics at dinner tables and in workplaces, it is often a sign that a particular phase of the rally is nearing exhaustion,” Hansen said. While precious metals have seen wild swings, bitcoin — once pitched as a form of “digital gold” and considered an alternative store of value — has languished this year amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is down roughly 10% this year, struggling to gain traction after closing slightly in the red for 2025. Bitcoin traded at around $78,050 as of Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, in South Korea, the market had its worst day in months amid nerves about companies’ spending on artificial intelligence. The drop comes while Wall Street is in the midst of corporate earnings season, and investors are similarly assessing the health of big tech companies’ spending plans on AI. US stocks closed higher Monday morning to kick off February trading: The Dow gained 515 points, or 1.05%. The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.54%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.56%. “While technically stores of value, still with strong long-term fundamentals, the total collapse in precious metals prices shows that any market can become gripped by mania, especially in the age of financialization and gamification,” Kyla Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said in a note. President Donald Trump’s announcement that he tappedKevin Warshas his Fed chair nominee also contributed to a shift in market sentiment. Gold futures were down 1.4% Monday. Silver futures fluctuated between gains and losses and were up 1.7% as of the afternoon. Despite the steep drop on Friday, gold is up roughly 8% this year and silver is up 13%. Trump made his Fed pick. But which Kevin Warsh will show up? South Korea’s Kospi soared 76% in 2025 and so far has been a leading stock market index this year. The country’s stock market has benefited from investor enthusiasm about AI as tech and chip companies have soared higher. Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, said in a note that recent moves in gold, silver, copper and South Korean tech stocks can be categorized as “exuberant” or “parabolic.” Emanuel said his outlook for stocks remains positive, and he expects the S&P 500 to rise roughly 13% this year. “The trader behavior has gone global, where people chase hot names,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “What we’ve seen now is a greater propensity to chase rallies.” “It’s not the same trade, but it’s the same trader mentality,” Sosnick said. US stocks had a remarkable 2025. But international markets did much better Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, who has been long on gold since 2022, said he thinks the sharp drop was an “unwind of crowded positions” as opposed to any “systemic risks.” Hansen at Saxo Bank said attention will turn to China, as investors there have been key drivers of demand for precious metals in recent months. Local prices in China have traded at a premium to the benchmark London market. Wall Street this week will get a slate of corporate earnings results including from tech stalwarts Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN) that could influence market moves. Investors in the coming months will also be attuned to Warsh’s remarks during his confirmation hearings for the Fed chair role. “It’s a market to watch for vulnerabilities and extremes,” said Darrell Cronk, CIO for wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo. The US dollar index was up 0.63% on Monday after rising 0.74% on Friday and having its best day since June, stabilizing after a recent slide. The rebound in the dollar can also put pressure on gold, which tends to benefit in a weaker dollar environment. Still, Deutsche Bank is sticking with its call for gold to hit $6,000 a troy ounce by the end of the year. “Significant institutional investors have signalled the probability of a gradual multi-year diversification away from dollar-denominated assets, and we are not aware that this has changed,” Michael Hsueh, research analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note.",2026-02-02T15:31:19.118Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/investing/gold-silver-bitcoin-us-stock-market,John Towfighi,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258484005.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:17
January jobs report will be delayed due to partial government shutdown,"For the second time in four months, a federal government shutdown has caused critical economic data to go dark. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will not release the January jobs report and other closely watched labor market data as scheduled this week because of the partial federal government shutdown. BLS officials told CNN on Monday that the agency is suspending the collection, processing and dissemination of economic data until federal funding is restored. “The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey release for December 2025, Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment release for December 2025, and the Employment Situation release for January 2026 will be rescheduled upon the resumption of government funding,” Emily Liddel, associate commissioner for the BLS’ Office of Publications and Special Studies, said via email. Prior to the shutdown, the latest JOLTS report, the metropolitan employment data, and the jobs report were scheduled to be released Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, respectively. Once funding is restored, those three reports will be rescheduled, she said. The US government partially shut down on January 31 after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on funding, an impasse sparked by outcry over the Department of Homeland Security ’s immigration enforcement actions inMinnesota–specifically the shooting deathsof US citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents. Senate Democratsvowed to blockthe House-passed bill unless several reforms were made to DHS or unless DHS funding was spun off separately — changes that would require another vote in the House. The government isn’t expected toreopen until at least Tuesday, when the House is expected to hold critical votes on a must-pass funding package. The latest funding lapse comes at a time when the BLS and other federal statistical agenciesare still trying to recoverfrom the last one, a historic, 43-day shutdown that spanned October and early November. The BLS data that was due out this week was expected to provide a crucial look at the health of the US labor market after what wasthe weakest year of jobs growth outside of a recession since 2003.",2026-02-02T18:40:21.091Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/economy/us-shutdown-january-jobs-report-bls,Alicia Wallace,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2244628019-20260202180515675.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:24
Companies are ditching business with ICE,"The backlash against ICE has grown beyond US borders. Capgemini, a major French consulting and information technology company, said Sunday it will sell a US division that does business with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Like other businesses with links to ICE, Capgemini has come under scrutiny as criticism mounts over the agency’s heavy-handed enforcement tactics. Jim Pattison Developments, a real estate company, and Hootsuite, a social media company, are two Canadian businesses that have faced public pressure for their links to ICE. Anti-ICE marcheswere held in several major US cities over the weekend in response to the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants, which has resulted in thefatal shootingsof two US citizens by ICE agents in Minneapolis. Capgemini’s decision follows revelations that the Department of Homeland Security had awarded the US division in question a$4.8 million contractin mid-December to provide ICE with “skip tracing services.” Skip tracing is the process of locating people who are difficult to find, using online information and other sources, such as voter registration data. “The nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm,” Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote in aLinkedIn postlast week. More anti-ICE protests underway nationwide after judge declines to immediately halt Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota The decision to sell the US division comes after a Paris-based corporate watchdog,Multinationals Observatory, published details of the contract, prompting questions from France’s finance and economy minister Roland Lescure. An archived Capgeminiweb pageposted on the watchdog’s website states thatCapgemini was working with ICE to “help it minimize the time required and cost incurred to remove all removable illegal aliens from the US.” In astatementannouncing the sale, Capgemini said legal restrictions associated with government work meant it was unable to “exercise appropriate control” over the US subsidiary’s operations to ensure it aligned with its objectives. Capgemini said the unit represented 0.4% of the group’s global revenue in 2025 and less than 2% of its US revenue. Meanwhile, Emily Lowan, the leader of the Green Party in British Columbia, has taken aim at Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison. Last week, she called on Canadians toboycottthe businesses owned by the Jim Pattison Group, which include grocery chains, packaging firms and car dealerships among others, unless he “cut his ties” with ICE. On Friday, Jim Pattison Developments, which is part of the Jim Pattison Group,saidit would no longer proceed with plans to sell a warehouse in Ashland, Virginia, to the US Department of Homeland Security. It provided no further details. The company has not responded to CNN’s request for comment. The industrial facility was to be used to “support ICE operations,” according to a letter last month from the Department of Homeland Security to officials in Virginia. Hootsuite has faced demonstrations over the work it does with ICE’s public affairs office. Protestors gathered outside the company’s Vancouver headquarters on Friday, calling on it to stop doing business with ICE. “Our use-case with ICE does not include tracking or surveillance of individuals using our tools,” Hootsuite CEO Irina Novoselsky said in astatementlast week. “We understand this is a complex issue and that people will hold strong opinions.” “What we are watching unfold right now is wrong,” she said. “The loss of life and the fear being felt in communities as a result of recent enforcement actions are devastating,” American companies are also taking action to distance themselves from ICE. The owners of a property in Oklahoma City are “no longer engaged with the Department of Homeland Security about a potential acquisition or lease,” according to the city’s mayor David Holt. “I commend the owners for their decision and thank them on behalf of the people of Oklahoma City,” Holtwrote on Xlast week.

Trump’s Kennedy Center closure may leave artists in limbo,"A version of this article first appeared in the Reliable Sources newsletter. You cansign up for free right here. During President Donald Trump’s first term in office, he didn’t even show up to the Kennedy Center Honors. He felt slighted by the performers, so he shunned the event at the famed John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. In his second term, Trump has tried to remake the cultural center in his MAGA image. Trump “was drawn to the institution for its cultural prestige,” Katy Waldman wrote forThe New Yorkerin December, but “he and his allies made it radioactive.” That’s why I’d categorize Trump’s Sunday night announcement about closing the building for a two-year renovation as shocking but not surprising. It did come as a shock: staff found out “via the president’s social media post,” CNN’s Donald Juddreported. But “there had been talk within the organization of a temporary closure at the end of the fiscal year — nominally for ‘renovations’ but also to stem the financial bleed affecting the institution amid the backlash from artists.” Indeed, the numbers tell the story. “In the past year, sales of subscription packages and tickets have fallen dramatically,” The Washington PostreportedMonday. “Empty seats became a common sight at the center.” Equally telling: The sheer length ofan NPR articletitled “Here’s who’s canceled their Kennedy Center performances since Trump took over.” Philip Glass withdraws his ‘Lincoln’ symphony from the Kennedy Center, citing conflicting values Trump’s involvement has been a turnoff to many arts patrons, even as he and his allies have portrayed the president as the venue’s long-needed savior. The flood of performer cancellations accelerated after Trump’s handpicked Kennedy Center board members voted to add his name to the institution last December.dann Trump was at the center just last week for the premiere of his wife’s documentary film “Melania.” So now we’re left wondering, asthis Vulture headlineasks, “Is Trump going to tear down the Kennedy Center?” Will members of the Kennedy family try to stop him? On “CNN This Morning,” Audie Cornish said the rebuilding plan reprises a question related to Trump’s East Wing demolition: “Is this a person who’s renovating because he’s not leaving, or is this a person renovating because everywhere he sees a potential real estate project?” Despite the recent surge in cancellations, a significant number of events are still slated at the performing arts center. The building is home to the National Symphony Orchestra, which performs multiple times per week during its active season. Regular performances of “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “The Outsider” musicals are still on the calendar. “If any forethought was given to the livelihood of the musicians who perform regularly in the Kennedy Center, no mention of it was made in the president’s statement,” Charles T. Downey of the Washington Classical Reviewwroteon Sunday night. The Washington Post noted, “It was not immediately clear what the closure would mean for annual events held at the center such as the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor or the Kennedy Center Honors.” Trump’s new East Wing ballroom is not expected to be ready in time. While short on answers about the impacts, Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell, a vocal Trump loyalist,tweetedSunday night that “this will be a brief closure in retrospect — and I am confident this sets the stage for a stronger, revitalized National Cultural and Entertainment Complex.” While Trump insists this is about fixing a “dilapidated” building, “it’s not the decor that has driven performers away. It’s the decorator,” David Axelrodremarkedon X. “Just like his casinos and other businesses, the Kennedy Center went out of business after he put his name on it,” Brett Meiselas, co-founder of the progressive outlet MeidasTouch,wrote. “Instead of allowing the Center to return to its arts mission, he’d rather close it than admit his vanity project was rejected by the American people,” former GOP lawmaker Barbara Comstockwrote.",2026-02-02T16:34:23.070Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/media/trump-kennedy-center-closed-national-symphony-orchestra,Brian Stelter,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258960824.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:39
Target’s brand new CEO faces a sales slump and turmoil in Minneapolis,"Target’s business is in a slump, competition is bearing down and its hometown of Minneapolis is in crisis from massive federal immigration operations. Michael Fiddelke officially took over as Target’s chief executive Sunday. Fiddelke started his career at Target as an intern in 2003 and rose up the company’s ranks. “We have real work to do,” he said in a public letter Monday. “We are equally clear on the opportunity in front of us.” Fiddelke will aim to recapture the company’s “Tarzhay” reputation for trendy fashion and home furnishings at affordable prices. Target for years stocked shelves with popular designer brands and its own labels such as Threshold, All in Motion and Cat & Jack. The mass merchant appealed to many consumers, but middle-income moms shopping for younger children formed a key customer base. Target’s sales boomed during the pandemic, when customers rushed to buy essentials, home goods and other products. But it’s fallen since then. Decades-high inflation squeezed customers’ budgets in 2022 and 2023, forcing them to cut back on discretionary purchases. Target got stuck with a glut of unsold pillows and laptops. Target also struggled to keep stores tidy and certain products in stock on shelves. Customers complained about long checkout lines and understaffed stores. Target was even late to get some stores ready for key holidays last year. Meanwhile, competition from Amazon, Walmart and Costco has intensified. These companies are larger than Target and have used their size advantage to drive down pricesand attract customers. Target’s sales have stagnated and its stock has dropped nearly 30% over the last three years. “It’s an enormous job. There’s a lot to fix there,” said Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at R5 Capital. Fiddelke also has to navigate a tense political situation in Minneapolis. Target and other big Minnesota companies have faced pressure to respond to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and the killing of two American citizens by federal agents there over the last month. Target has more than 50 stores in the Twin Cities. Protesters have gathered at many of its stores in the region to call on Target to repudiate the administration’s immigration operations, following thearrest of two Target employeesat a store in Richfield, Minnesota. Protestors rallied again outside Target’s headquarters on Monday, Fiddelke’s first day in the office, urging the company to call for ICE to leave Minnesota. This is tricky territory for Target, which staked out strong positions in support of racial diversity and LGBTQ rights under previous CEO Brian Cornell. Those stances drew backlash from conservative customers, and progressive customers grew frustrated at Target when it stepped back from them. Following the killing of Alex Pretti on January 24, Target joined dozens of other companies in Minnesota to issue a statement calling for the “immediate de-escalation of tensions” and for “state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.” Fiddelke also acknowledged the “incredibly painful” violence in Minneapolis in a separate video message to employees. He offered resources and support to staff members shaken by the killings. Fiddelke’s turnaround plans will focus on trying to introduce new brands and spruce up stores. Target is increasing capital spending by 25% to $5 billion to improve store operations, merchandise and technology. Target also recently opened a store in SoHo, the glitzy New York City neighborhood, full of stylish apparel, designer collaborations and beauty products. Target will use the store to test new concepts it may roll out nationally. Shoppers want “great design, real value and experiences that delight,” Fiddelke said in his letter Monday. “That’s where Target has always been at its best, and it’s what grounds the important work in front of us.”",2026-02-02T12:00:45.993Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/business/target-ceo-minneapolis-retail,Nathaniel Meyersohn,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2247871465.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:20:46
"Stablecoin law allows crypto firms to profit from fraud, prosecutors say","New York’s top prosecutors are raising an alarm on the crypto industry’s first legislative milestone, the GENIUS Act, alleging that the law fails to protect victims of fraud and gives legal cover to companies that are “profiting from fraud.” In a letter exclusively seen by CNN and signed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan’s Alvin Bragg, the prosecutors say the law has provided the “imprimatur of legitimacy” for a kind of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, while allowing firms that issue stablecoins to “avoid significant regulatory requirements that are needed to combat financing terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, and especially cryptocurrency fraud.” The GENIUS Act is a broad bipartisan effort, signed into law in July, to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency that has exploded in popularity in the largely unregulated market for digital assets. The law creates reserve requirements for coin issuers similar to rules that ensure banks hold enough assets to cover their liabilities — meaning firms that issue stablecoins must back their digital offerings one-for-one with liquid assets like US dollars or short-term Treasuries. Trump is primed to cash in on the crypto gold rush he’s helping create But James and Bragg take issue with what the GENIUS Act lacks — namely, language that would compel companies to return stolen funds to victims of fraud. That absence, they write, “will embolden stablecoin issuers, and even provide legal cover, when they affirmatively decide to keep stolen funds and proceeds under their control rather than returning them to victims.” Already, they claim, the two most dominant stablecoin issuers — Tether and Circle —  have throttled law enforcement efforts to seize and return funds to victims while profiting off the crimes that the prosecutors say remain prominent in stablecoin markets. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by volume, has the ability to freeze suspicious transactions of its USDT coin, the prosecutors write. But they say that it has only done so on an ad-hoc basis, and only when working with federal-level law enforcement. “The reality for many victims, therefore, is that funds stolen in or converted to USDT will never be frozen, seized, or returned,” the letter states. “They currently decide on a case-by-case basis when they will assist law enforcement in recovering funds for victims, and nothing prevents them from stopping all reissuance entirely.” Tether said in a statement to CNN that the company “takes fraud, consumer harm, and the misuse of USDT extremely seriously and maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward illicit activity.” The company, which is based in El Salvador, said that it “does not have a blanket legal obligation to comply with state-level civil or criminal processes in the way a US-regulated financial institution would. That said, Tether voluntarily works closely with US law enforcement at the federal, state, and local levels and routinely assists investigations aimed at protecting victims and preventing further harm.” Prosecutors allege that Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, which is publicly traded and headquartered in New York, “claims to be an ally in the fight against financial fraud.” But its policies “are significantly worse than those of Tether for victims of fraud,” the letter states. Even when Circle does agree to freeze funds, the prosecutors say, the company hoards them rather than return them to victims, collecting interest on the underlying assets. Crypto’s slump may be a cultural problem as much as a financial one That creates a “crystal clear” financial incentive to reject requests from law enforcement, the prosecutors say. “It is financially preferable to only freeze cryptocurrency deemed to have been stolen, but not return the underlying asset to law enforcement or any fraud victim, because Circle can continue to collect the interest through investment of the underlying funds.” In a statement to CNN, Dante Disparte, Circle’s chief strategy officer said the company “has always prioritized financial integrity and advancing US and global regulatory standards for stablecoins.” The GENIUS Act, Disparte said, “makes clear that stablecoin issuers must abide by applicable financial integrity rules for combating illicit activity, while enhancing clear consumer protection norms. We have followed prevailing rules as a U.S. regulated financial institution, and we will continue to advance these standards.” The letter, reviewed by CNN, marks one of the most forceful criticisms of the GENIUS Act from law enforcement officials since President Donald Trump signed it in July. While the bill received broad bipartisan support, critics have said it lacks sufficient protections for consumers and raises serious concerns about crypto volatility spilling into the mainstream financial system. And it comes asanother landmark, industry-backedcrypto regulation effort works its way through Congress. Proponents, including major crypto companies that lobbied for its passage, touted the GENIUS Act as a part of the industry’s goal of establishing, in President Donald Trump’s words, “a clear and simple regulatory framework,” for stablecoins, which have become the lifeblood of the crypto ecosystem. The prosecutors’ letter is addressed to Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand — the lead Democratic senator supporting the GENIUS Act —  and Mark Warner, who serves on the intelligence and banking committees. Sens. Schumer and Gillibrand didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson for Sen. Warner said “stablecoin issuers have a responsibility to comply with lawful court orders under the GENIUS Act and to cooperate fully with law enforcement to help victims recover stolen funds… Protecting victims is paramount, and Congress is continuing to evaluate whether additional legislative tools are needed to ensure issuers and law enforcement can act quickly to stop criminal activity and return stolen funds to their rightful owners.” In June, when the legislation cleared the Senate,Gillibrand toutedits potential to “enable US businesses and consumers to take advantage of the next generation of financial innovation.” Stablecoins, as their name suggests, are designed to hold a steady value by mirroring another asset, usually US dollars. One stablecoin should always equal roughly one dollar — a useful function for investors who want to keep their money within the crypto ecosystem without exposing their holdings to the wild swings that bitcoin, ether and other tokens are known for. They’re also seen as a kind of on- and off-ramp between crypto and mainstream financial markets that have historically had little overlap. What are stablecoins? Everything to know about the crypto being debated in Congress Last year, stablecoin transaction volumes soared 72% to $33 trillion, according toBloomberg News, which cited data compiled by Artemis Analytics. While bitcoin remains the most popular crypto token, its trading volume is eclipsed by dollar-pegged stablecoins. That relative stability, combined with the anonymity of crypto transactions, has also proven popular among criminals. Stablecoins now account for 63% of the illicit transactions that take place in crypto, according to Chainalysis, a crypto research firm. And while the crypto industry has beentrying to shedits longtime association with scams, cybercrime, drug trafficking and money laundering, the crime problem is far from resolved. Since 2020, Chainalysis estimates illicit activity on the blockchain — crypto’s core infrastructure — has grown by an average of 25% a year. Thieves and scammers have moved an estimated $28 billion into the world’s most prominent crypto exchanges over the past two years, according to a recent report from theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The New York prosecutors said they “regularly investigate criminal enterprises which use stablecoins to commit cryptocurrency fraud and launder stolen proceeds” and attempt to “freeze and seize” stolen funds to return them to victims. But the GENIUS Act, they say, hamstrings those operations while emboldening stablecoin issuers to resist law enforcement efforts to return stolen funds to victims. “Unlike any other type of cryptocurrency, Circle and Tether have the ability to freeze stablecoins” and “immediately halt the flow of stolen funds and criminal proceeds,” the letter says. Instead, they argue, “Tether has provided assistance only in limited circumstances, and Circle has chosen to actively thwart law enforcement and to profit from victims’ losses.” The prosecutors estimate that in 2024 Circle and Tether each made $1 billion in profits from investing their reserve funds, including reserve funds backing stolen and frozen stablecoins. As of November, they say, Circle had more than $114 million in frozen funds. For crypto critics, the GENIUS Act’s lack of fraud and restitution provisions point to an ongoing problem for the industry, where even basic consumer protections are missing. “All of that mundane stuff that has sort of been sorted out for traditional finance through decades of trial and error – it’s not there in the GENIUS Act,” Hilary J. Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrency, told CNN. “It was always open to the crypto industry to operate under the traditional rules… the laws were never incompatible with the technology.

Trump made his Fed pick. But which Kevin Warsh will show up?,"In June 2008, inflation was running hot — well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target — as oil prices surged. But there was another problem: a subprime housing crisis fueled by toxic mortgage assets. The crisis was so severe that Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns had collapsed just three months earlier. Kevin Warsh, like millions of Americans, was alarmed. Except Warsh, now President Donald Trump’spick to lead the Federal Reserve, sounded more worried about inflation than mass layoffs. “Inflation risks, in my view, continue to predominate as the greater risk to the economy,” Warsh, then serving on the Fed’s powerful Board of Governors, told his colleagues during the June 2008 meeting, according totranscripts. But just months later, unemployment would skyrocket to 10% in what later became known as the Great Recession. Even in the spring of 2009, just months after the spectacular implosion of Lehman Brothers and with millions of Americans out of work, Warsh sounded more focused on prices. “I continue to be more worried about upside risks to inflation than downside risks,” Warsh said during theApril 2009 meeting. Warsh’s crisis-era comments raise questions about just what kind of a Fed chair he will be, if confirmed by the Senate. While Trump has demanded lower rates — the lowest on the planet — Warsh isn’t known as a low-rates guy. Many on Wall Street view Warsh as an inflation hawk, someone who prefers higher rates to keep a lid on prices. In fact, Warsh is considered the most hawkish of the finalists to run the Fed. “The question is: Which Warsh do we get?” Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, told CNN. “The Warsh who was an inflation hawk at the Fed? Or the one who interviewed for this job?” In recent months, Warsh hasadvocated for lower rates, arguing that surging productivity and the AI boom are setting the stage for speedy growth without troublesome inflation. Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase, told clients on Friday that his “best guess” is Warsh will make the case for rate cuts, at least for this year. “We’d also suspect that as time goes on, his leanings will be more open to revision and perhaps reversion back to a more hawkish view,” Feroli wrote in a report, “particularly as we get past the midterms and into the last innings of a presumably lame duck administration.” Tellingly, JPMorgan isn’t penciling in any new rate cuts. Feroli said the bank still expects the Fed will “be on hold for the rest of the year” — even with Warsh potentially at the helm. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, told CNN that Warsh’s 2008-2009 calls on inflation are a “red flag” and evidence that he “got the policy response wrong.” Brusuelas added of Warsh: “His first instinct is hawkish and rarely saw a potential rate hike he didn’t like.” Of course, hindsight is 20/20. Warsh is hardly the only Fed official with comments that did not age well and he did vote in favor of the emergency steps the Bernanke-led Fed took at the time. Still, Wall Street certainly isn’t trading like Trump tapped a low-rate dove to run the Fed. US stocks retreated, the beaten-down US dollar rallied and theprecious metals trade blew up. Gold, which is viewed as a hedge against inflation and a loss of Fed independence, plummeted 8% on Friday. Silver, which had been on fire, crashed 25% — its worst day since 1980. “Kevin Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career and most importantly, during a time when the labor markets fell out of bed,” Renaissance Macro Research, a Wall Street research shop, wrote in apost on X.“His dovishness today stems from convenience. The President risks getting duped.” Trump has described Warsh as the “central casting guy that people wanted.” Warsh’s resume — a former economist under George W. Bush, Hoover Institution fellow and lengthy experience at the Fed — makes him look like a safe pick to lead the Fed under a traditional Republican president. In an alternate universe where Mitt Romney won the White House in 2012, Warsh could’ve become Fed chair. Stanley Druckenmiller, the billionaire investor and a mentor of Warsh, said it’s “not correct” to brand Trump’s Fed pick as “always hawkish.” “I’ve seen him go both ways,” Druckenmillertold the Financial Timeson Friday. Warsh has gone the more dovish way of late, a “convenient shift just as he became a Fed Chair nominee,” according to Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. Warsh’s theory of the case is built in part on his long-standing criticism of the Fed’s massive balance sheet. Warsh has said the Fed can shrink its balance sheet so aggressively that it will free officials to slash rates. However, JPMorgan’s Feroli is skeptical, cautioning that a smaller Fed balance sheet would likely lift long-term rates — driving up the same mortgage rates that Trump has been desperately trying to lower. “The balance sheet is wonky, but the real-world implications are not,” said Mills of Raymond James. “The focus on affordability and especially mortgage rates could be completely undone by this Fed pick.” One former Fed official who worked with Warsh is holding out hope that “the real Warsh” will stand up, eventually. “Kevin has wanted this job for a very, very long time. He’s a slick operator, highly skilled at climbing the greasy pole,” the official told CNN on the condition of anonymity. “But this post is his life’s endeavor. Getting it now, only to prove a toadie, would be a Pyrrhic victory. The longer he’s on the job, the more independent he can be.” Trump’s new Fed chair will likely outlast him in office. While Trump’s term in the White House ends in January 2029, the new Fed chair’s term could last through mid-2030. And the new Fed chair could get an assist from the Supreme Court. Justices at the high court, including conservatives,expressed skepticism during a hearing last monthabout Trump’s efforts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, it could give Warsh even more job security in case the president has buyer’s remorse (again). “Did Trump attempting to fire Governor Cook end up backfiring?” Mills asked. “A Supreme Court ruling reaffirming Fed independence will give Warsh more leeway not to be loyal to Trump.” It’s a concern that appeared to be very much on Trump’s mind last month at Davos. “Everyone that I interviewed is great,” Trump said of his Fed selection processduring his speechat the World Economic Forum. “Problem is, they change once they get the job … It’s amazing how people change once they have the job. It’s too bad, sort of disloyalty, but they got to do what they think is right.”",2026-02-02T10:00:47.378Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/economy/kevin-warsh-fed-trump-inflation,Matt Egan,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2211325883.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:01
Her agency crushed her K-pop idol dreams. Her reinvention brought them back to life – and won her a Grammy,"Her voice defeated soul-eating monsters during the emotional finale of the blockbuster animated film “KPop Demon Hunters.” But for Korean American singer EJAE, the triumph gave her something beyond fame and fortune. Years prior, EJAE was an aspiring K-pop star signed to one of the biggest entertainment agencies in South Korea. Starting at age 11, she had endured over a decade of demanding round-the-clock practice. It’s a common path for K-pop wannabes: Sign with an agency, train in dancing and singing, then hope the agency selects you to debut as an artist. EJAE never debuted; her agency let her contract run out without ever selecting her for a group. “I worked hard. I tried my best to make sure my voice sounded cleaner or dance better and to look a certain way. But I think I just didn’t make my mark,” EJAE told CNN in a recent interview. And when the constant competition and pressure began to affect her schoolwork, “I just felt like I was failing at everything.” “For a long period of time after (leaving the agency), I did feel very hopeless,” EJAE added. She’d risked it all, spending her youth on a dream that hadn’t panned out. But EJAE wasn’t done with the K-pop industry just yet. She took one more risk: She reinvented herself as a songwriter. That path led her back to New York and, eventually, to “KPop Demon Hunters.” The movie, the most-watched Netflix original film ever, centers around a Korean girl group that hunts demons with their songs to protect the world. EJAE co-wrote and recorded demos for the chart-topping soundtrack — most notably its uplifting anthem, “Golden,” which won a Golden Globe for “Best Original Song” in January. (EJAE is also the singing voice for the film’s purple-haired protagonist, Rumi.) It’s also up for an Oscar in March. And on Sunday, Golden became the first K-pop song ever to win a Grammy, landing the award for best song written for visual media. “It’s pretty rare for someone like EJAE, who’s a former trainee, to really blow up this big,” said Claire Marie Lim, an associate professor at Berklee College of Music and K-pop expert. Lim, who wasa K-pop traineearound the same time as EJAE, said most people she knew left the professional music world if they didn’t debut as K-pop idols. Some current K-pop stars might be involved in songwriting and production, but it was more unusual a decade ago — especially for former trainees. “The attitude at the time, like 10-plus years ago, was: ‘You’re meant to sing, dance, rap, model, do a lot of forward-facing things, but not really take part in the creative process behind the scenes,’” Lim said. EJAE was pursuing a “super rare” path that she would essentially have to create herself. Ironically, the movie that made EJAE a star is an ode to the Korean pop music machine that disillusioned her all those years ago. “KPop Demon Hunters” reflects how K-pop artists, also known as idols, bask in the glow oflight sticks and fan chants. But in real life, their fame comes with a high price: harsh beauty standards, 3 am call times for broadcasts, public backlash for dating and more. Even becoming a K-pop star often requires years of intense training, spending “hours a day dancing and singing and rapping,” Lim said. On “The Zach Sang Show,” EJAEdescribedgoing to vocal and dance practices after school and staying until midnight. (She also wasn’t the first in her family to pursue a career in entertainment; her grandfather was a famous actor and producer in South Korea in the 1960s and ‘70s.) Themassive K-pop machineis notorious for its artist development and production programs. Agencies meticulously plan out public debuts, coordinate every detail of schedules and fan interactions and even oversee many parts of stars’ personal lives. Trainees are also heavily scrutinized for their skills and appearance, often starting when they’re very young. EJAE was 11 years old when she joined SM Entertainment, one of South Korea’s biggest entertainment companies. “There’s a lot of competition, a lot of critiquing. There were competitions within the training system where I’ve failed a lot and was rejected a lot,” EJAE told CNN. “I’d constantly been hearing, ‘You’re not good enough, you’re not good enough.’” For those seeking K-pop stardom, the path can be long and grueling When her contract ended in 2015, EJAE was in her early 20s— already old for a K-pop trainee. It’s an exceptional case when agencies do debut older idols, “and I didn’t meet that exception,” she said. EJAE described her departure from SM as a breakup: amutualbreakup, but heartbreaking nonetheless. She had spent her formative years enmeshed with the company, and now she was on her own. She’d developed an interest in producing while at New York University, where she studied music during a break from training. Encouraged by her mom and brother, she would go to DJ performances in New York and ask them questions after shows. “‘If you want to get something, you have to be proactive’ — that’s always been instilled in me, and that was honestly the start of my journey of discovering myself as a writer, whether it be producing or not,” EJAE said. She spent hours each day teaching herself to use music software and how to make beats. She was intrigued by production, in part because she didn’t see many women in that side of the industry. While figuring out her next move after SM, she did a studio session with a Korean producer. She  thought they were going to make beats. Instead, he wanted her to write a song. “The last song I’d written…like actually wrote the melody and lyrics — was in college for a project, and it was a Christmas song and it was terrible,” she recounted. “So I was like, ‘What?’” But she gave it a go, and to her surprise, she fell in love with writing pop songs. The song she wrote that day was picked up and released as “Hello” by K-pop singer Hani. Creator of Netflix movie ‘KPop Demon Hunters’: ‘We’ve all wanted to see our culture represented correctly’ Although EJAE never debuted as an idol, the training helped her understand the structures and melodies that would work for songs. Andrew Choi, who would become her mentor, heard “Hello” and brought her onto his team and to SMsongwriting camps. (Choi is the singing voice for Jinu in “KPop Demon Hunters.”) “I think he saw potential in me, which I didn’t see,” she said. “Sometimes it just takes other people to see something in you for you to believe in yourself, too.” Since then, she has co-produced or co-written for a string of big-name K-pop acts, including Twice, Suzy and Aespa. Perhaps her most recognizable hit is “Psycho,” by Red Velvet. For “KPop Demon Hunters,” she’s credited onfour tracks, including “Golden.” Maggie Kang, the movie’s creator and co-director, said she contacted the songwriter at the suggestion of her husband. EJAE was initially brought on as a songwriter in 2019 and offered the lead singing role around 2022. “We cast EJAE first. We had the demos and knew that we wanted EJAE to do the vocals,” KangtoldForbes last July. In a social media post, she said the demos helped the film get the green light. EJAE, for her part, was more hesitant. She had never been cast in a movie before, and, at the time, no one knew “KPop Demon Hunters” would go on to become a global phenomenon. She enjoys being behind the scenes, where there’s less pressure, shesaidin an interview with The New York Times. “What made me say yes is the efficiency,” she said. “I wrote the song; I know the nuances and how to sell it. I was confident about that.” Now audiences are belting out her lyrics, and the music has given the movie a life beyond the screen. “Golden” held the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 for weeks last year, heard everywhere from grocery stores to dentist offices. Other “KPop Demon Hunters” songs similarly dominated the charts worldwide, with hundreds of millions of Spotify streams. We asked kids: Why are you so obsessed with ‘KPop Demon Hunters’? It’s a full-circle moment for EJAE. Twenty years after she hoped to be a K-pop star and 10 years after her dream was crushed, her voice and lyrics are reaching listeners across the world. “Golden” even found its way into global affairs: The leaders of Japan and South Korea recently played the song on the drums together inan usually loud display of diplomacy. When “Golden” won its Golden Globe, EJAE referenced her time as a trainee – and her reinvention. “This award goes to people who’ve had their doors closed at them,” she said, accepting the accolade with her co-writer and producers. “I can confidently say rejection is redirection, so never give up.”",2026-01-27T05:01:46.782Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/27/business/ejae-kpop-demon-hunters-risk-takers,Allison Cho,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2250257105.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:14
"Amazon touts ‘Melania’ box office success, though film well short of turning a profit","Fans of President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have made “Melania” a breakout hit by box office standards. The documentary is on track to earn about $7 million in its opening weekend, with ticket sales reflecting a familiar red/blue divide in America. “Melania” is projected to be the best-performing documentary of its kind in a decade, a takeaway that the first lady trumpeted in a post on X. Then again, “Melania” also received a marketing rollout unlike any other documentary, complete with ads on buses and commemorative popcorn tins at theaters. By financial standards, the film is not a winner, at least not yet. The company that financed it, Amazon MGM Studios, still has a long way to go to break even. On Sunday, Kevin Wilson, the head of domestic theatrical distribution for the studio, said, “we are confident in the long-term value this rollout will deliver to customers both in theaters, and for years to come on Prime Video.” Amazon paid $40 million for the rights to “Melania” and committed another $35 million for marketing — eye-poppingly high sums for a documentary. The Hollywood Reporter called it the “most expensive” such film in history. The exorbitant spending led Amazon’s industry rivals to speculate that the studio was trying to curry favor with the Trump administration by paying the first lady millions of dollars. According to the Wall Street Journal, “the First Lady’s cut is more than 70% of the $40 million,” or at least $28 million. “The Daily Show” host Desi Lydic phrased it as a question on premiere night: “Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?” Amazon asserted that “we licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.” Theatergoers said they did love it. The documentary received an A grade through CinemaScore, an industry-standard survey of theater patrons. The A grade was in stark contrast to the critical consensus. Professional reviewers — who weren’t given a chance to screen the film in advance — have panned “Melania” as a vapid infomercial. Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates film reviews, found only 11% positive reviews as of Sunday morning. “Melania” is not really a documentary at all, but rather a hagiographic “reality TV” special that “preaches to the faithful,” The Bulwark culture editor Sonny Bunch wrote. Bunch called it “fascinating to see so pure and naked an instrument of graft and propaganda deployed to great effect on an audience happy to lap it up.” Amazon MGM rightly calculated that the film would attract audiences across the country, particularly in Republican strongholds. Industry sources said the top-performing markets for “Melania” included Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, and West Palm Beach. Opinions about the film predictably broke along partisan lines. Trump critics shared screenshots of empty theaters in big liberal cites to mock “Melania” while Trump fans shared photos of group outings in conservative suburbs. The film’s opening weekend performance exceeded the expectations of box office prognosticators, some of whom had forecast “Melania” to make just $2 to $5 million over the weekend. The actual $7 million total puts the film on track at No. 3 overall for the weekend, behind the Sam Raimi-directed horror adventure “Send Help” and YouTube star Markiplier’s self-financed film “Iron Lung.” Given that “Melania” won’t be in theaters for long, there is no way that Amazon will recoup its costs from the theatrical release. But box office figures are not the only way to measure success, since “Melania” and three companion TV episodes are going to stream on Prime Video, and the studio can eventually recoup more of its spending via advertising and Prime sign-ups. A streaming premiere date has not yet been announced, but industry experts say most of the project’s overall audience will come on Prime Video. “We’re very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for ‘Melania’ exceeding our expectations,” Wilson said. “This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.” In any case, the suspicion about Amazon’s motives will linger long after the film leaves theaters. A New York Times reporter asked President Trump about it at the premiere on Thursday in Washington, DC. “Amazon paid $75 million to make and market this film,” reporter Shawn McCreesh said. “It’s an exorbitant fee. Many Americans think that this is maybe Jeff Bezos trying to get in good with you, and they would call it an act of corporate corruption.” President Trump interrupted and asked, “Who are you with?” After criticizing The Times, he sidestepped the topic, saying, “I’m not involved. That was done with my wife.” Over the weekend, he played movie promoter on Truth Social, urging people to “check it out” and linking to Amazon’s website for the film. On Sunday morning, the president linked to a news story about the ticket sales and wrote, “BLOCKBUSTER!” Meanwhile, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth isreportedlytraveling to Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sunday to visit Bezos’ Blue Origin, which announced last week that it would pause space tourism to focus on contracts with NASA for upcoming moon missions.

Many Haitians may soon not be able to work in the US. That will make caring for the elderly much harder,"Colin O’Leary recently had the toughest day of his career. The executive director at Laurel Ridge Rehabilitation & Skilled Care Center, O’Leary had to tell 13 of his top staffers — all Haitians with Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS — they were losing their jobs. That’s because the Trump administration is terminating the protection for Haitian TPS holders after February 3 as part of its broader immigration crackdown. Replacing the employees, who care for roughly 115 residents at the Boston center, will take time. They include hard-to-find, experienced certified nursing assistants and dietary aides who know their charges’ needs and habits –  who likes their chicken mixed with mashed potatoes while being fed, who needs extra help getting out of bed and who might be breathing a little more heavily, a potential sign of a health problem. Like O’Leary, elder care industry leaders nationwide are bracing for the loss of a key pillar of their workforce. Nearly 350,000 Haitians are set to lose their TPS this week, and a sizeable share of them care for older Americans. They work as nursing assistants, dietary aides, cooks, maintenance workers and other staffers in nursing homes, rehab centers and assisted living facilities. They also help senior citizens as aides in their homes. The looming departures add pressure to an industry already contending with 350,000 open positions — a shortfall that’s expected to grow in coming years as the nation ages. Overall, immigrants make up more than a quarter of workers who provide direct care in long-term care settings, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Notably, they make up nearly one-third of those who work in home care. The curtailment of immigration is “really creating problems for a sector that is already challenged from a workforce perspective,” said Katie Smith Sloan, CEO of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit providers of aging services. Some of her members already have to rely on costly temporary workers from agencies, while others turn prospective clients away because of a lack of staff to provide quality care. In Boston, the local elder care industry is suffering from a severe staffing crunch, which is only expected to get worse. The city has one of the largest Haitian communities in the US. O’Leary’s tight budget makes it difficult to raise wages to compete for new hires or turn to a staffing agency. Meanwhile, he’ll have to lean on his remaining employees to work a lot of overtime as he rebuilds the team, which he fears could take years. “I felt like I was letting them down as a leader,” he said of his Haitian employees. Haitian TPS holders are among the latest foreign-born residents whose lives are being upended by the Trump administration, which is focused on slashing the number of immigrants entering and living in the US. The Department of Homeland Security announced the termination of TPS designation for immigrants from multiple countries, including Honduras, Nepal and South Sudan, though federal judges have stymied many of those efforts. Many Haitian TPS holders are hoping that a federal judge in the District of Columbia will grant them at least a temporary reprieve. TPS relief applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters. The recipients are vetted and are not eligible if they’ve been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors in the US. The DHS secretary has discretion to designate a country for TPS. Haitian immigrants became eligible after an earthquake rocked the country in 2010. The designation has since been renewed multiple times as the country faces a host of crises, including widespread violence by armed gangs, food insecurity, displacement and a leadership vacuum afterthe president was assassinated in 2021. Several Haitians have sued DHS, arguing the department didn’t conduct the necessary review of whether it’s safe to return. The suit also alleged that the protection is being terminated, in part, because of President Donald Trump’s “racial, ethnic, and national-origin animus towards Haitians.” Asked for comment, DHS said that the Haiti’s TPS program “was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades.” “The assertion that the only way we can take care of our seniors is by allowing unvetted illegal aliens and foreigners with criminal records to remain in the country is grossly false and lazy,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. One TPS holder who cares for a senior citizen in New York told CNN that her heart pounds when she thinks she might have to go back to Haiti, which she fled in 2023. She’s afraid of being killed if she returns, but she also doesn’t know how she’ll be able to survive in the US if she can’t work. “There are a lot of insecurities in Haiti, and then there’s a lot of gang violence that continues to go up,” she said in Haitian Creole through a translator. Meanwhile, she also worries about what will happen to the elderly woman with whom she has developed a connection after caring for her for nearly two years. “She appreciates the help I provide to her,” said the caretaker, who asked that CNN not use her name for fear of reprisal from the federal government. In turn, she is proud that the woman trusts her. Many home care agencies are having difficult conversations with clients and their families, informing them that their caregivers will no longer be able to provide services, said Katia Guillaume, a vice president at Service Employees International Union Local 1199, which represents about 150,000 home care workers in three states. “When you are providing care so intimate as feeding and bathing, you develop a bond with someone,” Guillaume said. “To know that that person is no longer going to be here – when this person is sometimes the only person they see – it’s really hard for the patients. It’s hard for the caregivers. It’s hard for the employers.” Goodwin Living, which provides senior living and health care services to 4,000 older adults in the Washington, DC area, lost four workers from Haiti last summer when the Trump administration terminated their humanitarian parole. It took about six months to replace one of the cooks, said Rob Liebreich, CEO of the faith-based nonprofit organization. Soon, Liebreich expects to part with four more workers – including another cook – from El Salvador, whose TPS will expire in coming months. He fears those staffers will be even more difficult to replace since finding the right people is becoming ever more challenging. Already, Goodwin Living can’t meet the demand for home hospice and home health services because it can’t find enough workers. Now it’s considering whether to build more independent living rather than assisted living units that require clinical staff. “It’s making us think about what kind of services should we offer, what limitations are going to be in front of us in terms of staffing that may limit our ability to provide services,” he said. “And that’s not what we should be thinking about.”",2026-02-01T09:00:47.544Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/01/business/haiti-tps-immigrants-status,Tami Luhby,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1451119452.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:39
Analysis: Is the case against Don Lemon about winning — or about chilling journalism?,"Legally speaking, the federal charges against journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort are complex and unusual, sparking debate among lawyers about the legitimacy of the cases. But politically speaking, it’s pretty simple. The Trump administration wants to punish perceived opponents and raise the cost of critical news coverage. “This moment is bigger than two journalists,” a coalition of 40 journalism and free press groups said. “It is about whether the First Amendment has meaning when reporting is inconvenient to those in power.” Or as Fort herself said in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “Journalism is on trial.” Fort said “two dozen agents” showed up at her home with an arrest warrant early Friday morning. A law enforcement source told CNN that more than two dozen agents were involved in Lemon’s arrest as well. So the twin arrests were partly a show of force by the federal government and an expression of power, given that a magistrate judge rejected the government’s initial attempt to charge Lemon and several others. The Department of Justice, under pressure from prominent MAGA media influencers to arrest Lemon, then took the case to a grand jury and secured indictments that way. President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had no advance knowledge of “the Don Lemon thing,” brushing off reporters’ questions about the matter. He went on to call Lemon a “sleaze bag” and derided his career as a journalist. The White House hadcelebrated Lemon’s arrestwith a mocking post on X on Friday. Seth Stern, chief of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation, said “the charges are absolutely frivolous,” but suggested that a courtroom victory is beside the point. “The Trump administration, I’m sure, knows the baselessness of the charges, just like the lawsuits that Donald Trump files frivolously against news outlets,” Stern told CNN’s Victor Blackwell. Trump has “demanded $65 billion in damages from news outlets. The point is not to win,” Stern said. “He doesn’t think he’s actually going to those $65 billion. The point is to intimidate and chill lawful newsgathering. To make journalists think twice.” Many veteran journalists agreed with that assessment but said they would not be deterred from their work. Lemon himself said Friday night on his live-streaming show, “Now they’re trying to silence journalists. And I will not be silenced.” Administration officials say they are protecting the First Amendment rights of the worshippers who were at church on January 18 when anti-ICE protesters disrupted a service. The indictment alleges that Lemon and Fort were part of a “coordinated takeover-style attack” at Cities Church in St. Paul. Lemon and Fort, however, say they were simply there to report on the protest, not participate. The indictment relies heavily on Lemon’s own live-streamed coverage as evidence. It points out that Lemon previewed the “operation” in advance and said, “We’re not going to give any, any of the information away.” Lemon’s up-close-and-personal videos of the protest inside the church — showing some parishioners rushing to leave and even slipping on the ice outside, and others having tense discussions with the protesters — went viral. Many viewers were offended by the conduct of both the protesters and the journalists. The church disruption soon became a top story for Fox News and other pro-Trump media sources. Commentators sided with the worshippers and villainized Lemon, who has been a prominent Trump foe for years, including during his time as a prime time CNN anchor. Trump appointees in the Justice Department responded — sometimes personally on X — to MAGA demands for legal action. The government charged both journalists with conspiring against people exercising their freedom of religion and violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, known as the FACE Act. That act was created to protect reproductive health clinics and patients, and it also prohibits the use of force or threats to interfere with churchgoers. “To our knowledge, it is unprecedented for the Justice Department to deploy the federal laws cited in this case against journalistic activity,” Gabe Rottman, VP of policy at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told CNN. “Historically, the limited number of cases that have been brought against a journalist documenting a protest on private property have been handled as trespass cases at the state level,” Rottman said. “Those charges are almost always dropped, or if the cases go to trial, the journalists typically prevail.” Numerous First Amendment lawyers have similarly predicted that Lemon and Fort will prevail. Journalists have already been poking holes in the indictment’s dramatic description of the church disruption. For instance, the indictment asserts that Lemon and Fort tried to “oppress and intimidate” the church pastor, while Lemon’s live stream showed him calmly interviewing the pastor. If the cases ever get to trial, lawyers expect that government prosecutors would have a difficult time proving intent. “The government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they had the specific intent to interfere,” Greg Rosen, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted January 6 rioters, said on CNN’s “Laura Coates Live.” Rosen noted that “individuals who claimed to be journalists” were involved in the January 6 attack. Prosecutors did not look “to see what outlet they belonged to” or what they believed; rather, “we looked at what they did,” he said. “We looked to whether we can prove their knowledge, their intent, and their actions… That is something that I think is largely lacking here.” On Friday night, Coates interviewed Nekima Levy Armstrong, who helped lead the church protest, and Armstrong flatly denied that she “coordinated” with Lemon or Fort. “It was a clandestine operation, which meant no one other than the organizers had any information about where we were even going,” Armstrong said. Lemon and Fort were given an address for the protest location, but “they had no details… They didn’t know what was going to happen,” she added. Nevertheless, some Trump-aligned commentators have expressed confidence in the government’s cases. Megyn Kelly, who has a contentious history with Lemon, said Friday on her podcast that Lemon made a “colossal blunder” by going inside the private property of the church. “If he had stayed on that sidewalk, this would not be happening to him,” Kelly said. “But he didn’t. He joined the mob, he disrupted the service, he got in the face of the pastor and other parishioners, he was told to leave, he refused. He’s in a lot of trouble and it’s not because President Trump doesn’t like Don Lemon.” Lemon’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said Lemon will fight the charges vigorously. A wide array of First Amendment advocates condemned Friday’s arrests as something out of the autocratic playbook. “Journalism is not a crime. Reporting on protests is not a crime,” Amnesty International said. “Arresting journalists for their reporting is a clear example of an authoritarian practice.” The New York Times said in a statement that the arrests “continue a clear pattern of ignoring established law and infringing constitutionally protected rights to target reporting the administration finds politically disfavorable.” The Foundation for Individual Rights and ExpressionsaidFriday that the charges against Lemon “raise serious concerns for press freedom.” The group recently asserted that the conduct of the anti-ICE protesters at the church was not protected under the First Amendment. “But that doesn’t mean the federal government’s charges against Lemon — civil rights charges that require evidence he was threatening or physically obstructing congregants or coordinating such activity — are warranted,” FIRE’s director of public advocacy Aaron Terr said. “Manufacturing federal crimes out of the facts we’ve seen so far chills” the core reporting function of the press, Terr said. Referencing the White House’s post mocking Lemon’s arrest and the administration’s other actions against news outlets, he said, “That appears to be the point.” This story has been updated with additional information.",2026-01-31T18:40:13.322Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/31/media/don-lemon-trump-georgia-fort-civil-rights-doj,Brian Stelter,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26030863958925.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:51
Amazon’s layoffs are staggering. We’ve seen this before,"Big Tech continues to wrestle with mass layoffs, most recently with Amazon’s announcement to slash 16,000 jobs. It’s a trend that started long before the AI race: organizational change brought by the arrival of new technology. Tech giants flourish or falter based on their decisions to overhaul themselves, often leaving tens of thousands of workers to pay the price. The 1990s and 2000s saw a wave of layoffs from industry stalwarts like IBM, Hewlett Packard and Microsoft, which embraced technological advancements like personal computers, mobile devices and the cloud. Amazon’s staggering jobs cuts this week, the second wave since October, brings the commerce giant’s recent layoffs to roughly 9% of its corporate workforce. While Amazon’s layoffs aren’t a direct result of AI, they’re tangentially related. Advancements in AI have sparked widespread concern about the future of jobs, as fellow tech giantsMicrosoft,Meta and Verizon all made layoffs last year. AI is the “most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said when announcinglayoffs in October.She added that the company needs “fewer layers” to “move as quickly as possible.” In her memo explaining the new round of layoffs, Galetti wrote that Amazon aims to “strengthen” the organization by “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.” The technology industry has gone through a staggering wave of layoffs throughout 2025 amid growing concerns about the role AI will play in the future of work. If you’ve been laid off by a major tech company recently, we’d like to hear from you. How are you thinking about your career moving forward? Has this changed your outlook on pursuing a career in technology? The technology industry has gone through a staggering wave of layoffs throughout 2025 amid growing concerns about the role AI will play in the future of work. If you’ve been laid off by a major tech company recently, we’d like to hear from you. How are you thinking about your career moving forward? Has this changed your outlook on pursuing a career in technology? Companies are likely shiftingresources to areas like data, automation and analytics amid the AI race, according to Zeki Pagda, an assistant professor at Rutgers Business School. “Amazon cannot easily retrain a workforce built for manual logistics or legacy retail systems into one that builds generative AI agents,” Pagda said in an email to CNN. Amazon pointed CNN to Galetti’s memo when asked for comment. The company also said AI isn’t the reason behind the vast majority of the cuts, and that it will continue hiring in other areas. Galetti also wrote that “broad reductions every few months” are not part of Amazon’s plan. IBM is one of the most prominent examples of mass layoffs in response to new technology. The companylaid off50,000 people in 1993, whenchip technology evolved and the techindustrymoved away from large mainframe computers. Dealing with competition from smaller personal computers, IBM’sbusiness model began turning to services and software instead. “IBM’s challenge is not just to shrink in size but also to remake itself completely into a nimbler and more market-oriented player,” Time magazine correspondent Thomas McCarrollwrote in 1992. In 2014, Microsoft laid off 18,000 workers a few months into Satya Nadella’s tenure as CEO. Those cuts came just after Microsoft had absorbed Nokia’s mobile business, hoping to catch up to Google and Apple in the smartphone market. Ahead of those layoffs, Nadella wrote in an essay that the company needed to “flatten the organization” as it increasingly focuses on mobile and the cloud,The New York Timesreported at the time. There are other factors that contribute to layoffs aside from new technology, like overhiring, the state of the economy and a shift in corporate strategy. Cisco, for example, pivoted its business to stay relevant, according to Pagda. The rise of cloud computing in the 2010s forced Cisco to decrease its reliance on hardware networking equipment. It started investing more in areas like cybersecurity, data center technologies and cloud services, Pagda said — although doing so meantslashing thousands of jobs. Amazon’s big plan to beat ChatGPT: Give Alexa a better memory However,Amazon — a major player in both digital commerce and cloud infrastructure — isn’t at risk of becoming irrelevant, nor is it struggling financially. It raked in $180.2 billion in net sales in the September quarter alone last year and has a $2.5 trillion market capitalization. Still, the goal is tomake necessary changes before hardship. “One could argue this is Amazon’s leadership saying, ‘We’ve got to make these changes now because we see where the technology is headed and we see where the market is headed,’” Rob Siegel, lecturer in management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, told CNN.",2026-01-31T10:00:46.914Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/31/tech/amazon-layoffs-january-tech-changes,Lisa Eadicicco,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258083398.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:21:59
Trump says he’s decertifying Canada-made aircraft and threatens 50% tariffs,"President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he is decertifying all aircraft made in Canada and threatened a 50% tariff on those planes until American-made Gulfstreams are certified in that country. Trump specifically said he was decertifying the Global Express, a business jet from Quebec-based Bombardier, along with “all aircraft made in Canada.” “Canada is effectively prohibiting the sale of Gulfstream products in Canada through this very same certification process,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If, for any reason, this situation is not immediately corrected, I am going to charge Canada a 50% Tariff on any and all Aircraft sold into the United States of America.” The threat is the latest episode in a prolonged spat between the US and its next-door neighbor since Trump took office last year. Just hours earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he expects Trump to “respect Canadian sovereignty” after reports that Alberta separatists met with US officials. And a few days earlier, Trumpthreatened a 100% tariffon America’s second-biggest trading partner if it struck a trade deal with China. It is unclear whether Trump has the legal authority to decertify aircraft; the White House has not released an executive order on any Canadian aircraft tariffs. Trump did not specify any mechanisms to decertify the planes in his post. No president has ever decertified jets directly. The decision has always been left up to aviation safety experts at the Federal Aviation Administration, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of industry consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory. “Using aircraft safety as a tool in a trade war is just an incredibly bad idea,” he said. Bombardier issued a statement pointing out that it has 3,000 US employees spread across 9 US facilities as well as 2,800 US suppliers. One of such facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana, recently announced plans to expand. “Thousands of private and civilian jets built in Canada fly in the US every day,” Bombardier said. “We hope this is quickly resolved to avoid a significant impact to air traffic and the flying public.” Trump didn’t clarify whether the decertification action would apply to active or yet-to-be certified aircraft. But an industry source who spoke to CNN on background said that it was the industry’s understanding that it would apply to “new” private aircraft. “(There is) no indication from folks we’ve talked to that this would impact passenger aviation like Bombardiers that were manufactured 10+ years ago,” the source said. If Trump does ground all Canadian-made jets, it would be a blow to US airlines and passengers. In addition to business jets, Bombardier produces the CRJ regional jets used on so-called feeder flights. Those typically shuttle passengers from smaller airports to larger airports. United, Delta and American airlines all employ regional airlines for their feeder flights that use CRJ. So far, none of the regional airlines that provide those feeder flights have reported having planes grounded, Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the Regional Airline Association, told CNN Thursday evening. There are 648 passenger CRJ jets that were made in Canada that are in use by US airlines, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Those planes are scheduled to make more than 2,600 flights daily, with a total of 175,000 available passengers seats every day. Grounding those planes would not only cause widespread disruptions to the US airline schedule, it could leave many smaller airports in rural areas without air service. Regional airlines are the only source of flights for 64% of US airports, according to the Regional Airline Association’s data. “I think this is aimed at business (jets),” another industry source, who asked not to be identified, told CNN Thursday evening. “I’m well aware of what the (social media) post said, that it was all aircraft. But I would be really shocked if the intent was to ground the fleet that serves so many of the president’s supporters.” A White House official toldReutersthat Trump was not suggesting decertifying Canadian-built planes that are currently in operation.The White House didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment Friday. The FAA referred questions to the White House. Taking those CRJ jets out of the US air travel system would cause widespread chaos, Aboulafia said. “It would be a transportation disaster,” he told CNN. “If it’s only the Global Express, it’s not that big of a problem. But if it’s all Canadian-made jets … the (US air travel) system would be seriously impacted.” Canadian Industry Minister Mélanie Joly told theCBCon Friday that members of the Canadian government have reached out to their counterparts in the US government about Trump’s post. “When the president reacts, tweets, says something, we always take good note. We read, we listen and we don’t panic,” she said, adding that they believe “this can be resolved.” Steven MacKinnon, Canada’s transportation minister, posted on social media that he had spoken with Bombardier’s CEO as well as senior leadership with General Dynamics, its American corporate parent. Officials with Transport Canada are also in contact with the the US Department of Transportation, he said. “Canada’s aviation industry is safe and reliable. We will stand behind it,” hewrote. It’s also not clear from the Truth Social post if “all aircraft” refers to just planes or also helicopters. Canada is a major supplier of civilian helicopters, including medical evacuation helicopters used to move critically ill and injured patients.

Why Minnesota’s CEOs finally broke their silence,"Corporate giants in the Twin Cities stayed silent, publicly, for more than a month as massive federal immigration operations upended daily life and the local economy. Top Minnesota CEOs and business leaders had held phone calls about how to respond. Instead of going public, they settled on working behind the scenes to warn Trump administration officials and Republican leaders about economic damage from the surge of immigration agents to Minneapolis, say people close to the companies. The people spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Potential retribution from the administration and backlash from conservative customers and employees supportive of its mass deportation agenda stopped these companies from airing their concerns publicly of shifting policies, say people close to the decisions. Alex Pretti’s killing last week and growing national anger over the Trump administration’s immigration policies led companies to change course and make a public statement. The response said very little, but the fact that they spoke out at all spoke volumes about the severity of the situation in Minneapolis. Target, UnitedHealth, Best Buy, Cargill and dozens of other Minnesota-based companies issued a jointstatementlast Sunday calling for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” and for “state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.” “The recent challenges facing our state have created widespread disruption and tragic loss of life,” said the statement, released by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. Some Minnesota Democratscriticizedthe companies’ statement for failing to mention immigration, condemn the shooting of Pretti or Renee Good — another US citizen who was killed by a federal agent — or urge the administration to remove immigration officers from the Twin Cities. “It is far from sufficient. The clear way to de-escalate is for ICE to leave,” Minnesota State Rep. Michael Howardsaidon Facebook. “But I believe it’s a helpful step, albeit a small one.” Border czar Tom Homan announced Thursday he had ordered federal immigration authorities to workon a drawdown planin Minneapolis. A joint statement from Minnesota companies had been in the works prior to Pretti’s killing last week, but discussions accelerated immediately afterward, a person familiar with the letter said. Target’s incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke last Monday alsoacknowledgedthe “incredibly painful” violence in Minneapolis in a video message to employees. He offered resources and support to staff. Minnesota companies had resisted publicly denouncing immigration operations in recent weeks. Although customers staged protests at Target and other local stores, immigration officers arrested employees,and small businesses organized a citywide general strike, major companies deemed it too risky to speak out. Many companies, including Target, have been burned in recent years by taking and later reversing positions on social issues. Businesses are wary of a repeat. These companies, with operations around the United States and internationally, also monitor local and national sentiment closely. They judged that widespread anger over the crackdown in the Twin Cities had not spread nationally. The decision to speak up and the companies’ guarded language reflect how they are trying to stay in step with broad public sentiment, without antagonizing the administration. Polling on immigration operations hasworsenedin recent weeks and some Republican lawmakers in Minnesota and nationwide have started todistance themselvesfrom the crackdown in the state – signs the unease has spread. President Trump has also shifted his message, declining to say whether the officer who killed Pretti acted appropriately and said the administration was reviewing the incident. Staying quiet on a key economic issue like immigration represents a reversal in the public relations strategies of a once vocal group of corporate giants. Seventeen Fortune 500 companies are based in the Twin Cities, more per capita than any other US metro and in the top 10 globally. Business leaders call the region a“headquarters economy,”driven by a well-educated workforce of scientists, engineers, marketers and health professionals. The Twin Cities’ long tradition as a welcoming place for refugees and immigrants dating back to theVietnam Waralso helped make it a business-friendly hub. “The success of Minnesota’s economy, both now and in the future, is intrinsically linked to our immigrant communities,” Minnesota’s Chamber of Commercesaidin 2021. “Minnesota needs immigrant entrepreneurs and workers. They embody the spirit of our homegrown economy.” It’s also a noticeable contrast from how these companies responded to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in in 2020. After the murder, companies in Minnesota responded with public statements within days, built up internal corporate DEI teams, and pledged major investments to scholarship and workforce programs to expand diversity. Target, for example, invested billions of dollars in Black-owned vendors, opened stores in minority neighborhoods, and stocked shelves with LBGT-themed merchandise for Pride Month. Just a few years later, however, many companies scrapped their policies because of opposition from the Trump administration, right-wing activists on social media and lawsuits from conservative legal groups. “As a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future,” Target said last year. So Target and many businesses in the Twin Cities – and throughout America – went quiet. They’ve found very few reasons to stick their necks out, even tepidly.",2026-01-26T21:11:32.158Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/business/minnesota-companies-ceos-target,Nathaniel Meyersohn,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26025058364962-20260126200044697.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:22:24
Trump nominates inflation hawk Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair,"President Donald Trump said Fridayhe is nominating Kevin Warshto be the 17th chair of the Federal Reserve after Jerome Powell’s term ends in May. “I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Kevin Warsh to be the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, Trump wrote on his social media platform on Friday morning. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best.” In an Oval Office meeting later Friday, Trump further touted his pick, saying: “I would say that this was the perfect candidate. This was the man that’s most qualified, top student, best schools, everything was perfect, the youngest person ever to serve on the Fed. Got the whole package. Looks don’t mean anything, but he’s got the look, right?” Warsh is a somewhat conventional candidate for Fed chair:a former Fed governorwho was previously under consideration to be Treasury secretary in Trump’s second term and was a candidate for the top job at the Fed during Trump’s first term. Warsh was appointed to the Fed in 2006 at the age of 35, making him the youngest person to have ever served on the Fed’s powerful board. Warsh, now 55, has recently shifted his stance on monetary policy. A former inflation hawk, Warsh now favors lower interest rates, according to numerous public statements he’s made in recent months as Trump launched areality-show-like spectaclefor his Fed chair decision. He’s also called for overhauling the central bank’s workforce. “It’s reasonable to assume that he told the President he favors reducing interest rates today, otherwise he would not have been nominated,” wrote Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in commentary issued Friday. “Our instincts tell us Mr. Warsh will be more preoccupied with how history will view his record than with continuing to pander to the President.” Selecting a new Fed chair is one of the most important hires any president makes – but the nomination takes on even greater importance under this president. Trump has vowed to drive down the cost of living, and the Fed is responsible for maintaining price stability. Trump has railed against the Fed and Powell for the past year, berating Powell, his handpicked Fed chair, for not cutting rates. Earlier this month, Powell revealed in an extraordinary video statement that the Trump administration has launched a criminal investigation into the Fed and its chair. In hisextraordinary rebuke, Powell said the move was a “pretext” to intimidate the central bank to lower rates to the president’s liking. It’s been no secret that Trump has been unhappy with Powell, though it’s not clear he has the authority to actually fire him. However, Trumpwaved a termination letterin front of a group of House Republicans at an Oval Office meeting in August, according to three people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is actively arguing before the Supreme Court why it should proceed with removing Fed Governor Lisa Cook, whom the president said he fired in August. The Fed’s independence is at stake in the landmark case, but conservative Justices were already skeptical about the administration’s legal reasoningin oral arguments earlier this month. Trump names his pick to replace Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve Trump’s choice for central bank head caps off an extensive search process that at one point considered about a dozen people, from MAGA fixtures such asNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassettto even former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, according to Scott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury chief, who led the search. Bessent himself was also under consideration for the role but told Trump he’d prefer to remain in his current position. In addition to Warsh, the final four candidates were National Economic Council DirectorKevin Hassett, Fed GovernorChristopher Wallerand BlackRock’sRick Rieder. “Christopher Waller, Rick Rieder, and others, were interviewed for the Fed position. They all would have been outstanding, and have a great and unlimited future with “TRUMP.” Such amazing talent in our Country. Thank you!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday. Hassett would have been “a great Chairman,” Trump noted in a separate post. “But, quite honestly, he is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn’t want to let him go. Kevin is indescribably good so, as the expression goes, ‘if you can’t do better, don’t try to fix it!’” The Senate Banking Committee will consider Warsh’s nomination through a public hearing, then the broader Senate chamber will vote on whether or not to confirm him. But even that process may be tainted by the Trump administration’sextraordinary criminal investigation of Powell, a red line that some key Republican senators said Trump crossed that could hold up Warsh’s nomination until the investigation draws to a close. “No Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination until Trump drops his witch hunts of the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve and Governor Lisa Cook,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic member of the committee, said in a statement Friday. Trump’s efforts to politicize the Fed’s decisions have threatened to undermine the central bank’s prized independence. Members of the Senate Banking Committee will almost certainly ask Warsh about his shifting policy on interest rates and any potential promises he made to Trump about setting policy. He may also get questions about his father-in-law, Republican mega-donor Ronald Lauder. In 2002, Warsh married cosmetics billionaire heiress and businesswoman Jane Lauder, granddaughter of Estée Lauder. They met at Stanford. Jerome Powell’s remarkable advice to his successor speaks volumes about his battle with Trump Warsh worked as a White House economist in the George W. Bush administration. He is currently a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative-leaning think tank at Stanford University. Although Trump is seeking deep interest rate cuts to turbo-charge US growth, some economists and analysts note that Warsh once had a track record of pushing back against policies that stimulate the economy. For instance, in April 2009 during the middle of the Great Recession when the unemployment rate was surging, Warsh expressed concern about inflation. “I continue to be more worried about upside risks to inflation than downside risks,” Warsh said during a Fed meeting, according tominutesthat were later released. His own reason for resigning from the Fed in 2011 also underscores his aversion to loose monetary policy — at least before he was in the running for Fed chair this time around. “Kevin Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career and most importantly, during a time when the labor markets fell out of bed. His dovishness today stems from convenience,” analysts at Renaissance Macro Research posted on X Friday. “The President risks getting duped.” Warsh is seen in economic and financial circles as an experienced and serious policy figure with a deep resume. As a young Fed governor, he played a key role managing the financial crisis alongside then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and former New York Fed President Timothy Geithner, who later became Treasury secretary. However, he has shown he can be independent in the past: He stepped away from the central bank due to policy disagreements about the crisis-management tools the Fed used after the Great Financial Crisis. He was critical of quantitative easing, or large purchases of Treasury bonds to help lower long-term interest rates, saying later that such moves risked pushing up inflation and brought the Fed outside its core mandate. “He got the policy response wrong in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis,” Joe Brusuelas told CNN on Thursday. “He truly did not understand the nature, magnitude and implications of the Depression-like shock that occurred.” “During the defining crisis of our time – the Great Financial Crisis – Kevin Warsh continued to extoll inflation as the primary risk during 2007-08 as a massively deflationary event was unleashed via the near collapse of the American banking sector and freezing up of credit markets that ensued.”",2026-01-30T11:56:53.759Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/30/economy/kevin-warsh-nominated-fed-chair,"Bryan Mena, Matt Egan",business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2211325844-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:22:37
Velvet-rope security lines and grandpa’s heirlooms: Inside the rush to sell gold and silver,"In San Francisco, Seth Chandler’s business has lines out the door. It’s not unusual for twenty-odd people to be penned in by a velvet rope, monitored by two security guards. Chandler doesn’t own ahot new club or restaurant. He runs Witter Coin, which buys and sells precious metals — andpeople have been showing up in droves to sell their gold and silver. “I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s creating a lot of frenzy,” said Chandler who’s owned Witter Coin since 2016. “We’re buying and selling a lot.” The price of both metals has never been so high. Gold has doubled over the last year,crossing a record$5,000 an ounce for the first time this week. Theprice of silvertripled in that time. And as affordability remains challenging,everyday Americans, are cashing in where they can. Pawn and coin shop owners across the country tell CNN that more people than ever before are coming to sell gold or silver bars, bullions, silverware or broken jewelry. “We’re getting four to five times more people in our showroom than two years ago. It’s probably doubled the last six months with precious metals prices going through the roof,” said Chandler, who has doubled his staff to accommodate the demand. Gold and silver are considered “safe havens,” meaning assets where investors move their money when Wall Street gets nervous about the overall US economy — often because of macro issues and geopolitical tensions. So, when President Donald Trump threatens toacquire Greenlandor raise tariffs onCanadaorSouth Korea, the price of both metals rises. It’s “the belief or the hope that if you have major correction in the stock market or if you have suddenly inflation reemerging or accelerating, that gold and silver will be able to maintain its value,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, told CNN. High prices make selling gold or silver attractive, but it’s also good for the buyer. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America project gold could rise to $5,400 to $6,000 an ounce by the end of this year. Witter Coin, which also buys collectible coins, watches and jewelry, has occasionally brought in $1 million worth of metal in a single transaction,Chandler said. But with prices so high, it’s become more valuable for the shop to send the raw metal from those items to a refinery rather than resell it. “It broke my heart that we had a fascinatingly beautiful 18-karat gold pocket watch that was handmade in the 1880s. You’re talking 145 years old, probably took a couple of people a few weeks to make it all by hand, 180 different parts,” said Chandler. “And guess what? We had to disassemble it and melt the gold.” Kelly Swisher, the owner of Arlington Jewelry and Pawn in Arlington Heights, Illinois, said the currentprecious metal crazehas him buying tens of thousands of dollars’ worth each week. While gold has seen a steady rise for years, he’s surprised how much silver has caught fire. “I just had a big set (of silverware) come in and I ended up giving them $6,000,” said Swisher, who opened his shop in 2002. “I’m like, this is just insanity. A year ago, it would’ve been $2,800 or $2,700.” Silver prices surged 141% in 2025, the best performance since 1979, and they’re already up 32% this year. Beyond the metal’s safe haven status, prices are also being pushed higher because of strong industrial demand and lingering supply deficits. “We would see a couple people a week come in with silver (a month ago), and right now we’re probably seeing a dozen or more people every day coming in with some sort of silver product,” said Seth Gold, vice president of American Jewelry and Loan in Detroit, Michigan. Gold and silver are so hot that people aren’t just hauling in the family’s sterling silver set or gold bars from Costco. Customers are also digging through the drawers for scrap gold and unwanted or broken jewelry. For Americans struggling for basic cost of living, the sale has proven both lucrative and life-changing. “In this economy, if somebody’s coming in expecting to get a couple hundred dollars for this scrap gold and you tell them it’s $850, they all of a sudden just are overwhelmed,” said Swisher. “They can’t imagine that that little bag of junk that they had in their drawer is worth that much money.

Trump expected to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair,"President Donald Trump is expected to announce Friday his intentto nominate Kevin Warshto be the next Federal Reserve chair, according to two people involved in the process. Trump, who has been weighing the decision for several months and had narrowed down the list of candidates to four in recent weeks, told reporters on Thursday night he had finalized his pick and would formallymake the announcement on Friday. “I’m going to be announcing, I think, a really great choice tomorrow,” Trump said while arriving at the premiere of first lady Melania Trump’s documentary. Trump did not name his selection. Warsh met with Trump at the White House on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter, and administration officials have been preparing since for the former Fed governor to be Trump’s nominee. The White House and Warsh didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump declined to publicly name his choice, and administration officials cautioned that nothing was final until announced by Trump directly. Several officials noted that Trump has shifted his view on the best candidate several times over the course of the process. Jerome Powell’s remarkable advice to his successor speaks volumes about his battle with Trump But Trump appeared set in his decision on Thursday night, and the preparations for a White House announcement were underway, the people said. “It’s going to be somebody that is very respected, somebody that’s known to everybody in the financial world,” Trump said. “And I think it’s going to be a very good choice.” Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett,BlackRock executive Rick Riederand Fed Governor Christopher Waller were the final four candidates under consideration.  Trump held in-person interviews with each of the final four candidates as the final stage of a process that concluded earlier this month. Warsh has long been mentioned by Trump as one of his top candidates for the role and met with Trump in December for his formal interview. The sit-down was viewed positively by Trump’s advisors, and Trump told associates that he thought Warsh did well. He also made clear that Warsh, according to one person who spoke to him about the meeting, “looked the part.” Warsh served as a Fed governor for five years after being nominated by President George W. Bush. He’s been considered for top economic roles in the first and second Trump administrations and was viewed as a possible Treasury secretary pick before Trump tapped Scott Bessent. Warsh was also considered by Trump in 2017 for the Fed chair role, which ultimately went to Jerome Powell. “A lot of people think that this is somebody that could have been there a few years ago,” Trump told reporters Thursday night. Trump quickly soured on Powell in his first term andhas attacked and criticized the chairand the Fed relentlessly throughout the first year of his second term.",2026-01-30T04:54:25.533Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/business/trump-expected-nominate-kevin-warsh-fed-chair,Phil Mattingly,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2211325619.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:23:17
"Gold just hit a record $5,000. What’s driving the surge?","Gold prices surged beyond $5,000 per ounce for the first time late Sunday, as investors rushed to the safe-haven asset as concern spread that US President Donald Trump is upending relations with key allies, from Europe to Canada. In this year’s first 26 days, the price of gold has jumped 15%; a historic rally that builds on arecord-breaking year in 2025, when prices skyrocketed 65% – the largest annual gain since 1979. Gold is often seen as a refuge in uncertain times and a barometer of market anxiety. And this latest surge has been driven by a series of market-destabilizing global and domestic moves by Trump –– from thenow-revoked tariff threats against NATO alliesover Greenland, to the military operation against Venezuela, and thecriminal investigationinto Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Demand has also been driven by a weaker US dollar, higher-than-expected inflation, predictions the Fed will further cut interest rates this year, and the purchase of the precious metal by central banks around the world. Gold was up 1.4% Sunday to $5,058 a troy ounce, as of 8:14 pm ET. Silver, another safe-haven asset surging in value, rose 4.5% to $107.8 an ounce Sunday. Like Gold, Silver last year also recorded its best performance since 1979, with a 141% price increase. Despite hitting the $5,000 benchmark, analysts remained largely bullish on gold, arguing prices could rise further as uncertainty persists. Before the record rally, Goldman Sachs analysts had raised their forecasts of gold prices to $5,400 per troy ounce, citing private sector investors’ interests in the yellow metal due to “lingering global policy uncertainty,” according to a research note published by the investment bank last week. Others saw even more room for gains. Bank of America’s chief investment officer Michael Hartnett said in a research note last week that gold prices could peak above $6,000. Less than one month into 2026, Trump’s policy whiplash has fueled geopolitical uncertainty and rattled markets, pushing investors to bet on precious metals. Gold prices jumped following the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s threat against the Iranian regime amid a bloody crackdown on protesters. Trump also ramped up his rhetoric about annexing Greenland and threatened to reigniting a global trade war with tariffs on European allies that opposed his plans of acquiring the Danish territory. Even though Trump abruptly backed down and claimed a deal was reached on Wednesday, markets remained unsettled by the White House’s unpredictability. Then on Saturday, Trumpthreatened to slap 100% tariffs on Canadian importsshould the US neighbor make a trade deal with China – something Ottawa has said it has “no intention” of doing. Domestically, the US President has also renewed attacks on Powell, the Fed chair. Federal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into him earlier this month, throwing into question the political independence of the central bank. Together, these developments have unnerved investors, accelerating a flight into precious metals.",2026-01-26T02:19:23.312Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/25/business/gold-record-trump-global-concerns-intl-hnk,John Liu,business,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2257132036.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:23:30
"Trump is about to announce Powell’s replacement. One finalist backed Democrats, higher taxes and more immigration","President Donald Trump plans to announce his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair on Friday morning. Among the finalists is one man who checks many of the boxes: BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. The influential investor has the respect of Wall Street and deep knowledge of complex financial markets. Rieder is believed to prefer lower interestrates, a top priority for a president whowants massive rate cuts. And Rieder looks the part. His frequent television appearances areplaying well inside the White House. No wonder Riedervaulted to the top of the listof Fed chair candidates on prediction markets over the past few days. That changed Thursday night, when Trump said his pick wouldn’t surprise people, and “a lot of people think that this person could have been there a few years ago.” That strongly suggests former Fed official Kevin Warsh, who was a finalist for Fed chair in 2017, when Trump ultimately picked current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Warsh was at the White House Thursday shortly after Trump slammed Powell as a “moron.” But it certainly doesn’t eliminate Rieder, who still has better chances on prediction marketKalshithan White House economist Kevin Hassett and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller. And yet some of Rieder’s prior comments on Trump policy priorities, his lack of government experience and political donations to Trump critics could work against his candidacy for the powerful position. Rieder, a dark-horse contender for the Fed job, has in the past criticized one of Trump’s signature legislative achievements during his first term: slashing the corporate tax rate to 21%. “I think 21% is too low,”Rieder told CNN in March 2021. The BlackRock exec argued the benefit to business is “too high,” pointing to the fact that many corporations used their tax savings to reward shareholders with massive share buybacks. During the 2020 campaign, Joe Biden proposed raising the corporate tax rate. Rieder said at the time that the US economy could “definitely” withstand raising the corporate tax rate. “I would imagine he didn’t bring that up during his interview at the White House,” quipped Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. It’s not clear if Rieder still favors a higher corporate tax rate, which is not something the Fed chair has a direct say on in the first place. A BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment on Rieder’s five-year-old comments. During that same 2021 interview, Rieder downplayed inflationconcerns bubbling up at the time. He said inflation could accelerate to around 2.5% but stressed he wasn’t worried about “explosive” price increases. Rieder’s comments put him within the then-consensus among economists and even Fed officials who believed inflation would not become a persistent problem. But by June 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, broken supply chains and aggressive stimulus from the federal government, inflation skyrocketedto a four-decade high of 9.1%. Rieder may also have some policy differences from Trump on another top priority: immigration. In April 2023, Rieder voiced support for the exact opposite of Trump’s currentimmigration crackdown. Echoing concerns of many mainstream economists, Rieder said the United States needs more, not fewer, foreign-born workers to offset retiring baby boomers. “In most economies around the world, you need immigration,” Rieder saidduring a Morningstar podcast. He pointed to airlines, hotels and other companies that “can’t operate at full capacity” because they “just can’t find enough labor.” “With an aging population and, like I say, without immigration, it’s really, really hard to fix that,” Rieder said during the podcast. Indeed, USjob growth slowed dramatically last year– in part because thesupply of workers has declined sharplyas Trump has ramped up deportations. In sharp contrast to Rieder’s arguments in favor of immigration, the White House last week hailed negative net migration in 2025  – the first in half a century – as among Trump’s“365 wins”in his first 365 days back in office. “For the first time in 50 years, we are now seeing reverse migration,” Trumpsaid last weekduring a White House briefing. At the same time, Rieder has donated in recent years to Democrats including HouseMinority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Cory Booker and former Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, according tofederal filings. The BlackRock exec has also given money to Republicans, including Never Trumpers such as Nikki Haley, Jeb Bush and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Of course, campaign donations have almost nothing to do with Rieder’s ability to do the job of Fed chair. But they could hurt his case at the White House, given today’s hyper-partisan environment,Trump’s history of retaliatingagainst perceived foes and his desire to pick a loyalist for the job. Larry Kudlow, the conservative Fox Business anchor and former Trump economist, called out Rieder’s donations to “the never-Trumper” Haley and “ultra-left-wing” Democrats earlier this week. “Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett understand Trumponomics. They can be independent but still understand that the supply-side economic boom does not cause inflation. No one can be sure, though, about Wall Streeter Rick Rieder,” Kudlow wrote in a column forThe New York Sun. Asked about Rieder’s prior campaign donations, White House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump will announce his pick for the Fed “at the appropriate juncture.” “Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone’s time,” Desai said. Unlike Warsh and Hassett, Rieder’s resume also has a noteworthy gap: a lack of government experience. According to former Fed official Vincent Reinhart,all 10 Fed chairssince 1935 had a prior position in the executive branch. Powell, for instance, worked in the Treasury Department during the George H. W. Bush administration, while former Fed Chair Janet Yellen was a top economist in the Clinton White House. Rieder’s lack of government experience could steepen the learning curve if he were to get the job. On the other hand, this contrast with prior Fed picks could make Rieder even more attractive to Trump, who is not shy about busting norms. After all, neither Trump nor many of his Cabinet picks had previous government experience. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, told CNN that Rieder’s prior positions and campaign donations could make for “awkward moments” during a potential confirmation hearing. “But is there a smoking gun? Not yet,” Mills said. “And for Trump, having someone who has been in the private sector is a huge asset. Rieder is known and respected on Wall Street. And the market always tests the new Fed chair.” Mills said Trump knows he needs a strong economy and stable markets for Republicans to avoid a bad outcome in the midterm elections this November. The reality is there may be no perfect pick who checks all the boxes Trump is looking for in a Fed chair. For instance, Hassett favors lower rates but is viewed by some on Wall Street as too loyal to Trump – and that could backfire byroiling the bond market. Waller and Warsh are respected by investors but may be too independent for Trump’s liking. “The problem is none of the candidates have all the characteristics Trump wants: someone loyal, dovish and credible to markets,” Roth said.",2026-01-30T01:23:47.477Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/economy/trump-federal-reserve-powell-rick-rieder,Matt Egan,markets,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26012742302241.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:25:31
Jerome Powell’s remarkable advice to his successor speaks volumes about his battle with Trump,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell refused to answer three straight questions about politics during his press conference Wednesday. That’s typical for the just-the-facts persona he’s constructed for himself over the years. But near the end of his lengthy question-and-answer session, Powell got reflective and let the cat out of the bag. When CNN’s Matt Egan asked what words of wisdom Powell would give his successor, who is set to take over when Powell’s term as chair ends in mid-May, the Fed chair paused for a moment, chuckled, and said he had three pieces of advice. It was a touchingly human and thoughtful response. And it spoke volumes about the legacy Powell plans to leave at the institution he’s served for 14 years – nine as its chair. On Wednesday, he summed it up as his commitment to the “public well being” and staying out of politics. The Trump administration’s crusade against the Fed has threatened the institution’s independence that Powell holds so dear. He has said the Fed needs to remain independent to maintain its credibility that allows it to serve the public by working to keep unemployment and inflation low. The stakes are so high that the Fed leader deemed it appropriate to attend the oral arguments in the Supreme Court case of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who is challenging Trump’s attempt to oust her. For Powell, none of that is political, but rather a fight for the Fed’s independence. Over the past year, President Donald Trump and his allies have unleashed an unrelenting barrage of attacks against the Fed, claiming it has been too slow to lower borrowing costs. But it hasn’t been just name calling: The administration is actively arguing before the nation’s highest court why Cook, appointed by then-President Joe Biden, must be removed. Powell’s reflection, though never mentioning Trump or his actions, seemed aimed directly at the president. If passed through a Fedspeak translation engine, it might look something like: Because of Powell’s career-defining work to maintain the Fed’s independence, Trump’s attacks on the Fed are now backfiring. Instead, they have rallied support for the institution’s political independence, which the president has long sought to undermine. Trump’s campaign against the Fed took a shocking twist earlier this month, with federal prosecutors investigating part of Powell’s congressional testimony last year that touched on an ongoing renovation of the central bank’s Washington, DC, headquarters. The Fed chief pushed back against the administration in a stunning video released on January 12, describing the federal probe as a “pretext” to destroy Fed independence and usher in a world where “monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.” Powell hints at extended pause on rate cuts but stays mum on Trump attacks On Wednesday after the Fed announced it is holding rates steady, Powell refrained from commenting further on his statement against Trump, but he reiterated that Fed independence has “served the people well.” As Powell hinted at on Wednesday, several members of Congress — including some Republicans — have come out in support of Powell. But, more broadly, they spoke of how the Fed must operate beyond Powell’s term as chair. Current and former Fed officials are also standing up to Trump’s attempts to undermine the Fed. “Everybody is in favor of Fed independence,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of research at financial services firm Societe Generale. “I’m not surprised there’s been overwhelming support and that’s exactly the kind of affirmation of Fed independence that markets are looking for.” Several senators — from both parties — came out in support of Powell and the Fed after the central bank chief’semergency video statement. That’s key because some of them serve on the Senate Banking Committee, which will consider Trump’s pick to replace Powell. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a committee member, said in a statement he will “oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved.” He was joined by two other Senate Republicans, who don’t serve on the banking committee: Sens. Lisa Murkowsi of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both of whom said the Fed must remain independent. Still, other Republicans, even some close Trump allies, aren’t siding with the administration, instead striking a more modest tone in defense of Powell. For example, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, a Republican on the Banking committee, told reporters: “I would be stunned if he had done anything wrong.” Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, another Republican committee member, said Powell is “bad” at his job, but added: “I do not believe, however, that he is a criminal.” Fed officials have always supported their ability to set interest rates free of politics by merely pointing to long-standing evidence in academic research that an independent central bank often leads to better economic outcomes. But some current and former officials have been digging in their heels on why the US central bank must continue to manage rates without considering the president’s demands. Earlier this month when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the landmark case of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who is suing against Trump’s attempt to oust her from her role as a monetary policymaker over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, in attendance were Cook, Powell, Fed Governor Michael Barr and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke. When asked Wednesday why he attended, Powell said the Fed’s independence was at stake. “I would say that case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed’s 113-year history, and as I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn’t attend,” Powell said. Current Fed officials have tended to shy away from weighing in on Trump’s attacks, but several have come out in support of Powell in public appearances since, such as Fed presidents John Williams of New York and Alberto Musalem of St. Louis. Shortly after the Fed chief released his video, a joint statement signed by all living former Fed chairs – Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Alan Greenspan – stated its support for Powell’s defiance of Trump. The letter – also signed by other former high-ranking government officials, such as former Treasury secretaries Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin – said that the federal probe “is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence.” “This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,” they wrote. “It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success.”",2026-01-29T09:00:46.604Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/economy/federal-reserve-independence-trump,Bryan Mena,markets,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2250476325-20260128164014812.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:25:44
What Bad Bunny’s Grammy wins mean for Latinos in the US,"WhenBad Bunny’s album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” won album of the yearat this year’s Grammy Awards, the moment changed history. For the first time, a Spanish-language album took the Recording Academy’s most prestigious prize in an industry that has long treated Latino music as a category, not a centerpiece. For millions of US Latinos, the win from Bad Bunny – who on Sunday willheadline the Super Bowl halftime show– is more than a musical milestone. It is an affirmation of visibility, and proof of belonging. “It’s beyond inspirational,” said Jeffrey Vargas, a Nuyorican from Bushwick, Brooklyn. “It’s validating and ground-shifting in a moment when it feels like we’re all under attack. The album was more than a vibe. It was a spiritual uplift and a balm for the aching soul,” Vargas told CNN. Across social media and Latino communities nationwide, similar sentiments poured in: pride mixed with relief, celebration layered with resilience, after Bad Bunny clinched three Grammys total this weekend, including best global music performance. “As a Puerto Rican woman, I am beyond proud to see our culture, language, and history elevated globally. We are joyous, defenders of humanity, and our music is infectious,” said Lucria Ortiz, a Puerto Rican community leader from New Bedford, Massachusetts. For many Latinos, Bad Bunny’s success has always felt intimate. The Puerto Rico-born superstar never switched languages to break into the mainstream. He never softened his accent. He never diluted his musical and cultural references. “Instead of watering himself down to be more palatable, he added moresofritoto the pot,” said Liz Arreola, a Mexican-American content creator based in Houston, referencing the popular Caribbean/Latino seasoning blend used to build flavor. In hersocial media post, Arreola said she was incredibly proud of Bad Bunny’s win and the dignified way he is representing Puerto Ricans and Latinos on the global stage. “You can earn the world’s respect by being authentic to yourself, your people, your roots, your culture, your music, your island. That album was so authentic and so real, and it was precisely that authenticity that made the rest of the world connect and fall in love with it,” Arreola said in the post. For decades,Latino artists have been toldthat “crossing over” required crossing out parts of themselves: less Spanish, fewer regional sounds, more “universal” themes. But Bad Bunny did the exact opposite. He centered Caribbean rhythms, street slang and political commentary in an unapologetic celebration of Latino and Puerto Rican pride, which carried over into his acceptance speeches on Sunday night. That matters, says longtime political consultant, activist, philanthropist and producer Luis Miranda. “Bad Bunny’s win, and ‘Buena Vista Social Club’s,’ is recognition that Spanish-language music is part of the fabric of this country,” said Miranda, a producer of the hit Broadway musical whose original Spanish-language cast recording won the 2026 Grammy for best musical theater album. “Our music, our language, our people, have been here forever and will continue to thrive, forever,” Miranda said. The artist’s victory also comes at a time when Latino communities are facing intensified political rhetoric, immigration crackdowns, and perceived cultural erasure. Accepting the award for best música urbana album, Bad Bunny began his speech saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out! We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.” He added: “The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.” In that context, his wins feel even more urgent, making it not just about streams, sales, sold-out concerts or even awards, but about dignity and humanity. “We Latinos are being demonized in this moment. We all needed a reminder that centering love right now is exactly what America needs,” said Ortiz. His acceptance speech for best album, delivered almost entirely in Spanish, emphasized immigrants, dreamers, and those forced to leave home in search of opportunity. For many viewers, his words echoed the experiences of immigrants living in the United States. “On a global stage, his voice joined that of millions of immigrants who today live in fear, but also with hope. It wasn’t just an award. it was an act of solidarity with our community,” posted the staff ofNoticias Para Inmigrantes, a media organization serving Latino immigrants in the US.",2026-02-03T00:26:07.321Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/entertainment/bad-bunny-grammy-wins-us-latinos,Maria Santana,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2259521556.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:26:24
Grammy Awards 2026: See which nominees took home golden gramophones,"It was a history-making night at the Grammy Awards. This year’s Super Bowl halftime performer Bad Bunnytook home album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos),” which became the first-ever Spanish-language album to nab the top prize. Amidst an effusive and emotional acceptance speech in Spanish, the Puerto Rican superstar said in English, “I want to dedicate this award to all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country to follow their dreams.” Earlier in the show, Bad Bunny won for best música urbana album, and took a moment on stage to make a political statement, starting with a declaration of “ICE out,” which was met with extended, lengthy applause. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans,” Bad Bunny continued. “I also want to say to the people, I know it’s tough not to hate on these days and I was thinking, sometimes we getcontaminados…. The hate get more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. If we don’t hate them, we love our people. We love our family and that’s the way to do it. Don’t forget that please.” Another pre-show winner included last year’s Super Bowlhalftime show headliner Kendrick Lamar, who took home three Grammys before the show even started, nabbing another in the first hour of the telecast. With it, he broke the record previously held by Jay-Z and became the most awarded rapper in Grammys history. His wins this weekend included one for best rap album, for “GNX,” as well as record of the year alongside SZA for “luther.” Like Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish – winner for song of the year for “Wildflower” – also made unfiltered statements about ICE while accepting a Grammy. Standing on stage alongside her brother and producing partner Finneas O’Connell, Eilish, who has been an outspoken critic of actions made by ICE officials in recent weeks, said “no one is illegal on stolen land.” Eilish’s final statement on stage was bleeped by television censors, but according to video footage posted online by those in attendance, she said, “F**k ICE.” The most striking looks from the Grammys red carpet Going into Sunday’s show, Lamar led withnine nominations, including for album of the year for his “GNX.” Feted filmmaker Steven Spielberg clinched a Grammy before the show as well, joining theelite ranks of EGOTs(winners of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award) when he was awarded a statuette for best music film for the documentary “Music byJohn Williams,” which he coproduced alongside Ron Howard and many others.

"This is Cardi B’s Super Bowl, if we’re being honest","True to her inimitable fashion, this year’s Big Game might end up being all aboutCardi B. The “Bodak Yellow” rapper – who just this past weekend performed in Studio 8H as the musical guest for the 1000th episode of “Saturday Night Live” –has many believingthat she could be a featured performer during this year’s Super Bowl halftime show, headlined by thenewly crowned album of the year Grammy-winnerBad Bunny. She won’t have far to travel, since Cardi B will already be at the game. Like Taylor Swift last year, the spicy rapper has a personal interest in the Super Bowl in that her boyfriend, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, will be playing in the celebrated game alongside his team, the New England Patriots. There were high hopes for Super Bowl LIX last year, since Swift was already in attendance to cheer on her now fiancé Travis Kelce and his Kansas City Chiefs, and fans hoped she would take to the halftime show stage with headliner Kendrick Lamar for a rendition of her “Bad Blood” remix – on which Lamar was a collaborator. That didn’t happen, but now that Cardi B is in her WAG (as the wives and girlfriends of athletes are called) era hopes are running high that she might fulfill the double-duty dream of attending to cheer on her man while also taking the stage for one of the biggest performance events in the world. Goodness knows, Cardi has given the people reason to hope for such things. Her enthusiasm for both football and Diggs, with whom sheshares a newborn son, has been much on display recently. The Grammy winner has shown up at games dressed as if it were Fashion Week, rocking looks from a vintage pink Chanel tweed set to an all-gray leather look by Jagne which included a corset. The woman born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar has made quite the statement, and the NFL has taken notice. Her flowing mint green wig provided a conspicuous flash of color when the sports organizationposted a celebratory video on their verified Instagram accountof her declaring, “We’re going to the Super Bowl!” after the Patriots secured their place by defeating the Denver Broncos during the AFC Championship game last week. Cardi B’s eye-catching coif was accompanied by a massive fur coat when she talked to NFL Network reporter Cameron Wolfe about Diggs and how he fought his way to the Super Bowl. “I’m feeling very excited, and very happy for him, very proud of him,”she said.“You know, he just came back from an ACL and me seeing the progress and the process of him going from there, from the first time he started running back and now joining the Patriots and actually going to the Super Bowl. I’m very excited for him, very excited for the whole team.” The star’s transformation into a football superfan has helped her to be ubiquitous of late, from hanging with Patriots owner Robert Kraft toher reported upcoming performanceat Michael Rubin’s Fanatics Super Bowl Party planned to be held in San Francisco the day prior to Super Bowl LX. But it’s the belief that Bad Bunny will bring her out for the halftime show that has many most excited. Not only have the pair collaborated before along with fellow Latin artist J Balvin on Cardi B’s hit 2018 single “I Like It,” but four years later, Bad Bunny ended the US leg of his “World’s Hottest Tour” by having Cardi join him on stage at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. She was so impressed by it all that she tweeted about it. “I was just at this stadium for the super bowl not long ago ..There’s more people here today at bad Bunny’s concert then the Super Bowl! …….Literally artist goal !!!!!”she wrote at the time. It would therefore be somewhat prophetic of Cardi B should she end up on the actual Super Bowl stage this weekend with Bad Bunny.",2026-02-02T12:00:46.437Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/entertainment/cardi-b-super-bowl,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258187262.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:27:19
Some of ‘Star Search’s’ biggest losers became megastars. Can the revival live up to its past?,"“America’s Got Talent,” “The Voice,” “American Idol” — would any of them exist without “Star Search?” The iconic staple of ’80s and ’90s television laid the groundwork for today’s ubiquitous talent competition shows, with one big exception: When it came to crowning big stars, it had a tendency to get things wrong. Everyone from Britney Spears to Justin Timberlake to Aaliyah appeared on the show — and lost, as did future 35-time Grammy winnerBeyoncé, whocompetedin 1993 as part of an all-girls group called Girls Tyme. “Can you believe it?” William Pilipchuk, lead singer of rock group Skeleton Crew, which bested Girls Tyme in a moment immortalized on Beyoncé’s single “***Flawless,” told CNN. “I’m the only singer that beat Beyoncé in a contest on national television.” The band’s guitarist Scott Christy recalled going backstage after the judges advanced their all-male, all-acoustic rock band to the next round over the preteens of Girls Tyme. “There were tears,” Christy told CNN. “It was horrible. I just felt bad.” Now, “Star Search” is back, this time on Netflix, with actor Anthony Anderson as host. The new incarnation – the second reboot after CBS’s failed 2003 attempt – is buzzier, bigger, live and flashier. But its somewhat nonsensical pairings remain, as in a recent episode that featured a trapeze artist duo going up against a trainer doing a dance routine with her dog. The revival is off to aslow start. It remains to be seen who, if any, of the first batch of contestants – which which includes several magicians and a singing comic, among others – will become America’s next big star. But as the winners and losers of the past know, the results of “Star Search” often have little to do with what they find after. Singer and songwriterKatrina Woolvertonhad her chance at stardom in 1989. Heron-screen competitionin the junior vocalist category was a 10-year-old singer who belted a version of “My Funny Valentine.” Her name was Aaliyah. In an interview with CNN, Woolverton remembered Aaliyah as having a “quiet manner about her” and that she was “a little more reserved but incredibly talented.” Woolverton wound up besting Aaliyah and went on to become the round one junior vocalist champion. The loss didn’t keep Aalyiah down. Just five years later, she released her debut album, “Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number.” Woolverton’s music pursuits panned out differently. After the show, she received offers from record labels but ultimately left the music industry after facing some adversity at home, opting to focus on her education instead. She eventually returned to music as an EDM artist, which is her focus today. Aaliyah, meanwhile, went on to release three studio albums following her debut, spawning five top 10 hits that charted on theBillboard Hot 100.Widely regarded as one of the most promising artists of her time, her untimelydeathin a plane crash in 2001 cut short her meteoric rise. “There’s no sweetness in that victory because she’s not here anymore,” said Woolverton. “I always thought I’d have the chance to cross paths with her and congratulate her and just tell her, ‘I was so proud of you to see that you did it.’” Mega fame didn’t findSkeleton Crewafter “Star Search,” but the band didn’t do too bad for themselves. They got a record deal and had a chance to tour in support of artists like Foreigner and Kenny Loggins. They only found out later that their success came from what one of the most influential artists of the century once called a “defining moment” of her childhood. Beyoncé directly addressed her loss, alongside Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett, 30 years after it happened,sayingin 2013: “You’re never too good to lose, you’re never too big to lose, you’re never too smart to lose. It happens. And it happens when it needs to happen and you need to embrace those things.” The same year, she featured footage of the moment in hermusic videofor “***Flawless.” Skeleton Crew reached out after the single dropped, and Pilipchuk admits he still has a “bitter taste” that he never got a reply from Beyoncé or her team. Skeleton Crew disbanded in 1995, and Pilipchuk and Christy now perform in a band called The Crystal Set. Pilipchuk insists he is still largely unfazed by the fact that he and Skeleton Crew have any connection to Beyoncé’s meteoric rise. Christy has a softer view, crediting the experience as “the gift that keeps on giving back to us.” The original “Star Search” debuted on CBS with famed TV personality Ed McMahon as the host in 1983 and aired until 1995. Considered the first talent competition reality show, it featured head-to-head match-ups in categories including solo and group vocalist, comedy, spokesmodel and dance. Netflix’s updated version nods to its predecessor with its voting, allowing for judges Chrissy Teigen, Jelly Roll and Sarah Michelle Gellar to hand out up to five stars. The live format also lets viewers act as the fourth judge by voting in real time. ForMarty Thomas, a Broadway vet who competed against Britney Spears in 1992’s junior vocalist competition, the experience on the show was so profoundly positive that he hopes the revival captures some of that magic for its new slate of young stars. “When you’re rebooting something like ‘Star Search’ that so many people hold such a soft spot in their heart for from the ‘80s, I really hope they’re able to at least strive to capture a little of that innocence and that reality,” Thomas told CNN, fresh off a string of cruise ship performances. Innocence is a good word for it. After competing against one another on “Star Search,” Thomas, Spears and their families went on to become friends in the years that followed. He and Spears even attended the same performing arts school in New York City, and he was part of the pop singer’s life until the mid-2000s, bearing witness to her meteoric rise. Ultimately, he observed, her rejection on “Star Search” did not have that much of a negative impact “beyond breaking her heart.” If anything, Thomas continued, the experience just “strengthened her resolve to keep working harder and try new things.” “Star Search,” of course, isn’t the only reality competition show to reject greatness (here’s looking at you,Jennifer Hudson, EGOT). The reboot is, however, leaning into that notion that even if you lose, you win. Perhaps Anderson put it best when he bid farewell to the trainer and her dog after the trapeze artists knocked them out, saying, “now the whole world knows who you are.”",2026-01-28T18:24:28.461Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/28/entertainment/star-search-beyonce-britney-aaliyah-skeleton-crew,Alli Rosenbloom,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1297834258.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:27:41
Actor Paul Dano responds to Quentin Tarantino’s criticism of him,"ActorPaul Danohas broken his silence aboutQuentin Tarantino’sharsh criticism of him. The “Pulp Fiction” director launched a scathing attack on Dano during an interview with “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast” in an episode released last month. During the conversation, Tarantino said his fifth favorite film of the 21st century was “There Will Be Blood” – but he added a caveat. He said the 2007 movie, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, would have been his first or second favorite were it not for “a big giant flaw in it, and the flaw is Paul Dano.” Adding insult to injury, he went on to describe Dano as “such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy.” Dano, who played two roles in the movie as identical twins Eli and Paul Sunday, didn’t publicly address the director’s comments, although some of Hollywood’s biggest stars jumped to his defense. Now, a reporter fromVarietyhas asked Dano at a 20th anniversary screening of “Little Miss Sunshine” at the Sundance Film Festival about Tarantino’s outburst. Although Dano did not speak directly to Tarantino’s comments, he said of the support he’d received: “That was really nice. I was also incredibly grateful that the world spoke up for me so I didn’t have to.” Dano has received support from some of Hollywood’s biggest names. Toni Collette, who starred alongside Dano in the Oscar-winning movie “Little Miss Sunshine,” said in the article published Wednesday: “Are we really going there? F**k that guy (Tarantino).” She added: “Who does that?” Meanwhile, actor and director Ben Stiller posted onXlast month: “Paul Dano is f-ing brilliant.” And Reese Witherspoon said onThreads: “Paul Dano is an incredibly gifted, versatile actor. More importantly, he is a gentleman.” During his speech for best actor at the AARP awards earlier this month, George Clooney said: “I don’t enjoy watching people be cruel to actors,” adding that he would be “honored” to work with Dano. George Clooney has some choice words for Quentin Tarantino, who said he doesn’t think Clooney is a movie star The “Little Miss Sunshine” directors also sprang to Dano’s defense this week. Jonathan Dayton told Variety that Tarantino’s comments were an “embarrassment,” adding: “I can only think that his (Dano’s) rawness of his performance made Tarantino uncomfortable.” Valerie Faris added: “You know what was interesting was the people coming out to defend Paul … he is loved by so many. He is so smart.” CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.",2026-01-29T11:04:20.177Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/entertainment/paul-dano-reacts-quentin-tarantino-criticism-scli-intl,Lianne Kolirin,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20260129-dano-tarantino-split.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:27:57
David and Victoria Beckham family drama pulls in a generation unafraid to go ‘no contact’,"For a few hours this week, it felt like the world and all its horrors stopped with one subject taking over the internet: Brooklyn Peltz Beckham. People feasted on every morsel after the eldest child of David and Victoria Beckham dropped six slides on his Instagram Stories accusing his famous parents of planting stories in the media about him, portraying “inauthentic relationships” on social media and trying to ruin his wedding to his wife, Nicola Peltz. Peltz Beckham launched his broadside with a statement of purpose: “I do not want to reconcile with my family.” With that, though he didn’t use the term himself, Peltz Beckham entered the fervent discourse shaking Gen Z and their Gen X and Boomer parents: going “no contact,” or dropping those family members deemed too toxic and incapable of change. In private conversations and very publicly on TikTok, the idea of going “no contact” is debated from all sides. On the one hand are those who choose to drop relationships — often hailed by their peers for choosing themselves over whatever situation led to the fissure. On the other are the parents who have been banished by their children, some expressing confusion, and others findingtheir own influencer lanein telling their side of the story. Karl Pillemer, a professor of human development at Cornell and author of the book “Fault Lines: Fractured Families and How to Mend Them,” told CNN that though there is a heightened awareness about adult children going no contact, thanks in part to social media, there is no actual hard data to show that there has been an increase. Back in 2020, Pillemer told the Cornell Chronicle he “found that 27% of Americans 18 and older had cut off contact with a family member, most of whom reported that they were upset by such a rift.” What he now sees at play is that younger people, including Gen Z, are receiving more support on social media when they decide to break with their families, even as their parents struggle to understand the language their kids are using to express why it’s happening, like “gaslighting” and “narcissistic parenting.” “For one, there’s social media encouragement that has become more acceptable,” Pillemer said. “Two, there’s this kind of disconnect between what some young people seem to expect from the parent-child relationship that is very different from their parents’ understanding of what they were doing.” No longer, he said, do adult children have to stay connected to their family because “blood is thicker than water” as the younger generation has “less of a feeling that I will live with this relationship if it isn’t fulfilling no matter what.” When it comes to the Beckhams, the educator said he was reminded of a conversation he had on an episode of the “Sibling Rivalry” podcast, hosted by celebrity siblings Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson, about negotiating family relationships via social media. “I would say this is not a good way to handle estrangements,” he said “It draws an incredibly powerful line in the sand when you out the entire relationship. And it’s very difficult then, ‘cause those things live forever.” Another part of the draw to the Beckham scandal is the behind the scenes glance it gives into a powerhouse celebrity family. From the love-at-first-sight moment footballer David Beckham met then-Spice Girls singer Victoria Adams during a 1997 soccer game, the couple seemed to be living a fairytale. Their firstborn was an integral part of their love story. Named for the New York City borough where his parents discovered they were expecting him, he was the four-month-old ring bearer at their 1999 nuptials at Luttrellstown Castle in Dublin, Ireland. As he grew older, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham seemed to work hard at finding his niche. He’s been a barista, a model, a photographer and an aspiring chef complete with his own line of hot sauces. The celebrity progeny appeared to be seeking out his place in a world that had been aware of him since birth. He touched on the subject in “What I See,” a book of his photographs published in 2017, when he was 18. “I don’t think being in the public eye has affected me too much. I’m just used to it,”he reportedly said at the time.“Obviously I have to be more aware as a teenager that someone may be capturing shots of me unaware.” His father also touched on it in a 2023 Netflix docuseries, “Beckham,” at one point getting emotional when talking about his four children. “We’ve tried to give our children the most normal possible upbringing as possible,” the elder Beckham said. “But you’ve got a dad that was England captain and you’ve got mum who was Posh Spice.” The family also includes sons Romeo and Cruz and daughter Harper. “And they could be little s**ts, and they’re not,” he added. “And that’s why I say I’m so proud of my children.” That public perception shifted this week when Peltz Beckham took to Instagram, criticizing his parents’ “performative social media posts” and saying the facade has “been a fixture of the life I was born into.” CNN has reached out to representatives for the Beckhams for comment. The Beckham family feud previously lived only in the pages of tabloids and on social media, where there were tales of tension between the Beckhams and their eldest progeny and his wife. Rumors began swirling shortly after Beckham, 26, married Peltz, 31, at a ceremony in Palm Beach in April 2022, to which the bride wore a Valentino Couture dress – not a gown designed by her soon-to-be mother-in-law, a fashion mogul. There was so much gossip that the newest member of the Beckham familygave an interview to The Sunday Times in October 2022denying that she was at odds with her in-laws. “I don’t know why they say feud?,” she told the paper. “I mean, maybe they picked up on something? And now they’re labelling it feud? No family is perfect!” Brooklyn Peltz Beckham revealed how far from perfect by posting this week with a slew of accusations against his family. “I’m standing up for myself for the first time in my life,” Peltz Beckham wrote. It was a direct move from a young man who many believe has had a soft life since the very beginning. But it is just that perception of him having lived the “good life” that aided in captivating the interest of the public, who were given a stark reminder that even in the spotlight, a family split can still be devastating.",2026-01-22T21:06:57.000Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/22/entertainment/david-beckham-victoria-brooklyn-no-contact,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2243112724.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:28:09
"What you missed at the 2026 Grammys: Politics, nudity and appearances by legends","Bad BunnyandKendrick Lamar, two artists unafraid to hold a mirror up to America through their music and performances, dominated theGrammy Awardson Sunday night. Bad Bunny made history when he won album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos)” – the firstSpanish-language albumto achieve the top honor – while Lamar also broke records with five wins, including best rap album and record of the year, becoming the most-awarded rap artist in Grammy history. Bad Bunny got emotional after winning the night’s top prize, making his way to the stage with tears in his eyes before acknowledging his homeland of Puerto Rico and dedicating his win to “all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams.” He made a more pointedanti-ICE statementearlier in the evening while accepting the Grammy for best música urbana album. “We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans,” Bad Bunny said, after deploying the phrase “ICE out,” which has been used as a call for an end to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Next Sunday, Bad Bunny will take to theSuper Bowl Halftime Showstage for a performance that has been marked by anticipation and criticism from conservatives. Lamar knows what that feels like. He was theperformer for Super Bowl LIXand used his time on sports’ biggest stage to deliver a politically-charged performance that featured Samuel L. Jackson dressed as Uncle Sam. The Grammy Awards weren’t just about political statements, however. There were several stand-out performances and tributes to beloved musicians who passed last year and so much more. Here are some of the night’s other notable moments. Cher appeared to have something resembling a“La La Land” momentwhile presenting Kendrick Lamar and SZA with the record of the year Grammy, when she misread the envelope, awarding the Grammy to the late Luther Vandross, whose first name is the title of the song that was awarded. This plus some teleprompter issues made for an awkward moment. In her defense, she tried to walk off stage after accepting her lifetime achievement award. So, maybe she knew this wasn’t the job for a legend like her. Television censors couldn’t keep up with Lola Young’s excitement over winning best pop solo performance, failing to properly bleep a four-letter expletive that escaped her mouth during her acceptance speech. The button was ready to go, however, for Billie Eilish’s acceptance speech for song of the year, during which said “F**k ICE,” according to videos posted to social media by those in the crowd. Fun fact: Eilish and her brother and collaborator Finneas became the first songwriting duo to win three times in the category. As if Steven Spielberg needed another Hollywood accolade, the famed director achieved EGOT status after he scored a Grammy win during the Grammys preshow on Sunday. Spielberg won a Grammy in the best music film category for “Music by John Williams,” on which Spielberg is credited as a producer. This marks his first Grammy. Spielberg has won three Academy Awards, one Tony and four Emmys. The in-memoriam segment fittingly had a touch of metal this year, with a performance in honor of the late Ozzy Osbourne. With Slash on guitar, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith on percussion and Post Malone singing the vocals, the ensemble played a cover of Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs” to honor the band’s late leader. The moment was an emotional one, with the camera cutting to the fallen rocker’s family, Sharon, Kelly and Jack Osbourne, who were all seen tearfully watching the performance. Lauryn Hill subsequently took the stage to perform a medley of her greatest hits, and paid tribute toD’Angelo, who died in October. Earlier, country superstar Reba McEntire launched the in-memoriam segment by singing “Trailerblazer” alongside Brandy Clark and Lukas Nelson, in what was McEntire’s first-ever performance at the Grammys. McEntire’s stepson Brandon Blackstock, a talent agent and Kelly Clarkson’s former husband,died in Augustand was honored during the segment. The Dalai Lama is a Grammy winner. The spiritual leader was awarded the honor for the audio book that accompanied his title “Meditations: The Reflections of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.” Host Trevor Noah was also nominated in the category. In a statementposted to Instagram, the Dalai Lama wrote that he accepted the award “with gratitude and humility.” No shirt? No problem — at least at the Grammys. Chappell Roan stepped onto the red carpet wearing a sheer burgundy frock, with its top components held up solely by the hoops of what appeared to be nipple rings. Doechii channeled “Death Becomes Her” in a bejeweled chest piece that probably stressed out the sound operator at the Grammys when it jangled in the mic, and Teyana Taylor floated into the show wearing an abdomen-bearing sparkly gold gown. Justin Bieber also took a note from the skin-loving ladies, wearing only a pair of silvery blue silk boxers for his first performance on the Grammys stage in four years. Whether they were performing on stage – looking at you sombr, Addison Rae and Alex Warren – or accepting an award like best new artist winner Olivia Dean, the musicians of TikTok had a great night. The same can be said for artists whose older songs felt new again because they happened to find new listeners on the popular social media network. You might know that Sabrina Carpenter’s “Manchild” came out in June 2025, but it was new to some! In a night that made history all around,one record-breaking moment came from the world of K-Pop. The infectious and uplifting anthem “Golden” from the surprise Netflix hit movie “K-Pop Demon Hunters” scored a pre-telecast Grammy win on Sunday, when it clinched the award for best song written for visual media. The banger, sung byEJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami of HUNTR/X, was nominated for four Grammys total this weekend, including song of the year. Lady Gaga delivered a powerful speech after winning a Grammy in the pop vocal album category, using her time on stage to encourage women in music to “always listen to yourself and always fight for your ideas” when they’re in the studio, which can sometimes be a male-dominated space. “Fight for yourself as a producer and make sure that you are heard – loudly,” she added.

Bad Bunny uses Grammy Award win to protest ICE,"One week before he’s set to headline theSuper Bowl LX halftime showand on a night when he made Grammys history, Bad Bunny used his time on stage to deliver a pointed political message that protested the recent actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Accepting the award for best música urbana album, Bad Bunny began his speech saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out!” The crowd inside the show, which took place in Los Angeles, overwhelmingly responded with cheers, according to what was heard on the telecast. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens,” he said. “We are humans and we are Americans.” The most striking looks from the Grammys red carpet After pausing while the audience applauded, Bad Bunny continued: “I know it’s tough not to hate on these days, and I was thinking, sometimes we getcontaminados– I don’t know how to say that in English – the hate gets more powerful with more hate.” “The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love,” he said. “So, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.” The phrase “ICE out” has been used at protests as a call for an end to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Bad Bunny won a total of three awards on Sunday, one of which was a history-making win for album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos).” It is the first time a Spanish-language album has claimed the Recording Academy’s top prize. During his emotional acceptance speech, delivered mostly in Spanish, Bad Bunny dedicated his win to “all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country to follow their dreams.” Bad Bunny’s comments come amid nationwide anti-ICE protests that took place over the weekend. On Friday,Bruce Springsteenmade a surprise appearance at a concert organized by Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello in Minneapolis, an event that benefitted the families ofRenee Nicole GoodandAlex Pretti, who were both killed by federal officers last month. Springsteen released a song last week titled “Streets of Minneapolis,” which he dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, as well as Good and Pretti’s memory. Billie Eilish also spoke out against ICE on stage at the Grammys, but viewers at home did not hear the full extent of her comments. While accepting the Grammy for song of the year for “Wildflower,” Eilish, who has been an outspoken critic of actions made by ICE officials in recent weeks, said “no one is illegal on stolen land.” “It’s just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,” she continued, going on to encourage everyone to “keep fighting and speaking up and protesting.” The end of her speech was bleeped by television censors but, according to video footage posted online, Eilish said, “F**k ICE.” Earlier in the telecast, best new artist winner Olivia Dean also made a politically-tinged statement on stage. The British singer and songwriter, who has Caribbean roots, acknowledged during her acceptance speech that she is the “granddaughter of an immigrant.” “I’m a product of bravery, and I think that those people deserve to be celebrated,” she said. “We’re nothing without each other.” Grammys host Trevor Noah took a more lighthearted approach to commenting on the state of the union. During his opening monologue, he made a joke about rapper Nicki Minaj – who recently called herself President Donald Trump’s “number one fan” – was not at the Grammys because she was “still at the White House discussing very important issues.” Trump later shared his thoughts on the telecast on Truth Social, calling the Grammy Awards “virtually unwatchable.” Noah also did a bit with Bad Bunny prior to the musician’s win, asking if he could live in Puerto Rico if things keep getting worse in America. “Well, I have some news for you,” Bad Bunny said. “Puerto Rico is part of America.” Bad Bunny’s comments will likely fan the flames of controversy that have dominated the conversation around his halftime performance since his selection was announced. Some in conservative circles have been opposed to his appearance on sports’ biggest stage since it was announced, stemming from the fact heexcluded the continental United Statesfrom his 2025-2026 concert tour, a decision he said he made out of fear that ICE could potentially raid the concert venues. Others on the right have been critical of Bad Bunny’s music catalogue, which exclusively contains Spanish songs. Conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA created counter-programming to Bad Bunny’s Halftime Show performance that the organization says is more aligned with their values. The lineup of performers has not been confirmed.",2026-02-02T03:26:41.480Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/01/entertainment/bad-bunny-grammys-speech-ice,"Sandra Gonzalez, Alli Rosenbloom",entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2259486677.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:28:31
Claire Danes says she freaked out when she found she was pregnant at 44,"Claire Daneshas said she went into “meltdown” when she discovered she waspregnantwith her third child at age 44. The “Homeland” star revealed that she burst into tears when she found out she and her husband, the actorHugh Dancy, were expecting their third child. Speaking toAmy Poehlerfor her podcastGood Hang, the actress said: “I called my ob-gyn in convulsive tears. It was a pure … it was all meltdown.” It was not just Danes’ age that made the news a surprise but the fact that she had previously struggled to conceive. “None of this was by design,” she said, adding that her three children are all five years apart. “I didn’t know it was physically possible — I was 44. And actually Rowan (Danes’ second son) was very hard-earned. I had to do two rounds of IVF. It just was so unlikely.” Danes, who shot to fame starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann’s 1996 “Romeo + Juliet,” told Poehler that she had been at a spa with a close friend, to whom she confided her suspicion that she might be pregnant. “I wasn’t going to say anything and finally I admitted it,” she told Poehler, saying that she said to her friend: “I totally lost my mind last night and just decided I was pregnant. I went down this crazy rabbit hole and finally looked up what are the odds of naturally conceiving at 44 and they’re like less than 1% one per cent.’ I was like ‘so that obviously is ridiculous.” In response, her friend revealed that she had had a dream that she herself was pregnant — but was in Danes’ body. Celebrities like Pedro Pascal and Billie Eilish begin to condemn deadly shootings in Minneapolis amid ICE surge Danes recalled that she had “two strong cocktails” and the following day took a test. “It was like bold, cap lock PREGNANT and I burst into tears,” she said. “And then this beautiful girl emerged and she’s the best and none of it was up to me and I’m just delighted,” she said. Although it is not the first time that Danes has spoken of her surprise at becoming pregnant — when she appeared on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in 2023 she said “this one was a surprise” — it is the first time she has revealed her daughter’s name: Shay. Earlier in her chat with Poehler, Danes said of her daughter, who was born in July 2023: “Shay, my baby, she’s very kind of in her head and dreamy.” Back in November, in an interview with Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett on theSmartlesspodcast, Danes said her pregnancy experience was “really interesting.” She explained: “It was weird — suddenly I felt, like, a funny shame … like I was naughty.

‘War of the Worlds’ and ‘Snow White’ remakes lead the Razzies,"It’s time to celebrate the best of the worst in movies. Two remakes top the list of the 46th Annual Golden Raspberry nominations, known as the Razzies, announced on Wednesday. “War of the Worlds,” which like the 2005 film of the same name starring Tom Cruise is based on H. G. Wells’s 1898 novel “The War of the Worlds,” racked up 6 nominations. Ice Cube was nominated in the worst actor category for his performance as William Radford, a Department of Homeland Security officer who reckons with a potentially apocalyptic alien invasion. Disney’s “Snow White,” a live-action remake of Disney’s 1937 animated film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” also nabbed 6 nominations. A worst supporting actor nod went to “All Seven Artificial Dwarfs” in the film. The awards take a tongue in cheek approach to cinema by handing out awards for those films that are, shall we say, viewed as less than stellar. As is tradition, the “winners” are announced the day before the Academy Awards ceremony. The following is the full list of nominees for the Razzies: Ice Cube and His Zoom Camera / “War of the Worlds” (2025) Robert DeNiro and Robert DeNiro (as Frank & Vito) / “The Alto Knights” The Weeknd and His Colossal Ego / “Hurry Up Tomorrow” “The Electric State” / Screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Adapted from the illustrated novel by Simon Stalenhag “Hurry Up Tomorrow” / Screenplay by Trey Edward Shults, Abel Tesfaye, Reza Fahim “Snow White” (2025) / Screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson and a bunch of others too numerous to mention. Drawing from the original fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm “Star Trek: Section 31” / Screenplay by Craig Sweeny with original story concept developed by Bo Yeon Kim and Erika Lippoldt “War Of The Worlds” (2025) / Screen Story and Screenplay by Kenny Golde and screenplay by Marc Hyman, adapting the classic novel by H.G.

Thousands of fans celebrate life of legendary Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir in San Francisco,"Thousands of people gathered Saturday at San Francisco’s Civic Center to celebrate the life of Bob Weir, the legendary guitarist and founding member of the Grateful Dead who died last weekat age 78. Musicians Joan Baez and John Mayer spoke on a makeshift stage in front of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium after four Buddhist monks opened the event with a prayer in Tibetan. Fans carried long-stemmed red roses, placing some at an altar filled with photos and candles. They wrote notes on colored paper, professing their love and thanking him for the journey. Several asked him to say hello to fellow singer and guitaristJerry Garciaand bass guitaristPhil Lesh, also founding members who preceded him in death. Garcia died in 1995; Lesh died in 2024. “I’m here to celebrate Bob Weir,” said Ruthie Garcia, who is no relation to Jerry, a fan since 1989. “Celebrating him and helping him go home.” Saturday’s celebration brought plenty of fans with long dreadlocks and wearing tie-dye clothing, some using walkers. But there were also young couples, men in their 20s and a father who brought his 6-year-old son in order to pass on to the next generation a love of live music and the tight-knit Deadhead community. The Bay Area native joined theGrateful Dead— originally the Warlocks — in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including “Sugar Magnolia,” “One More Saturday Night” and “Mexicali Blues.” He was generally considered less shaggy looking than the other band members, although he adopted a long beard like Garcia’s later in life. The Dead played music that pulled in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams. Their concerts attracted avid Deadheads who followed them on tours. The band played on decades after Garcia’s death, morphing intoDead & Companywith John Mayer. Darla Sagos, who caught an early flight out of Seattle Saturday morning to make the public mourning, said she suspected something was up when there were no new gigs announced after Dead & Company played three nights in San Francisco last summer. It was unusual, as his calendar often showed where he would be playing next. “We were hoping that everything was OK and that we were going to get more music from him,” she said. “But we will continue the music, with all of us and everyone that’s going to be playing it.” Sagos and her husband, Adam Sagos, have a one-year-old grandson who will grow up knowing the music. A statement on Weir’s Instagram account announced his passing Jan. 10. It said he beat cancer, but he succumbed to underlying lung issues. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, who were at Saturday’s event. His death was sudden and unexpected, said daughter Monet Weir, but he had always wished for the music and the legacy of the Dead to outlast him. American music, he believed, could unite, she said.",2026-01-18T05:51:43.077Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/18/entertainment/bob-weir-memorial-grateful-dead-hnk,Associated Press,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256818001.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:08
"Phil Collins says he has 24-hour live-in nurse care, as he details health struggles","Phil Collinshas opened up about his recent health challenges, revealing that he has 24-hour live-in nurse care. The British rock star said that “everything that could go wrong with me, did go wrong with me” in recent years. The former Genesis frontman, who turns 75 on January 30, was speaking to British presenter Zoe Ball for the final part of BBC podcast series “Eras” about his illustrious career. He told Ball that he’s had five operations on his knee. “I can walk, albeit with assistance,” he said. “I have a 24-hour, live-in nurse to make sure I take my medication as I should do,” said Collins, who first shot to fame in the 1970s. “I’ve had challenges with my knee, I had everything that could go wrong with me, did go wrong with me. I got Covid in hospital, my kidneys started to back up,” said the singer-songwriter, drummer and record producer. “I’d probably been drinking too much, and so my kidneys were messed up,” he added. “I wasn’t one of those guys that sort of stayed up all night drinking. I’d drink during the day, but I guess I had too much of it.” “It is just one of those things that happened and it all caught up with me and I spent months in hospital.” Collins said he hoped to get “back to being totally mobile and healthy,” though he was unsure if he would ever get to perform live again – his last concert was in 2022. Despite his poor health, Collins struck a note of positivity. “I couldn’t have wished for a more varied and eventful playing career,” he said. Collins has previously spoken about his failing health. In a2021 interview, he said he couldn’t play the drums any longer. His son Nic Collins replaced him on drums for a Genesis reunion tour, while he stuck to the vocals. He’s had a series of fractures over the years and in 2015 underwent back surgery, which left him with nerve damage. In 2017, he fell,which resultedin him using a cane to assist with walking. Collins, who is three-times divorced, is father to four other children besides Nic. His daughter, Lily Collins, is the protagonist of hit Netflix show “Emily in Paris.” Asked by Ball what life had taught him, Collins said there’s a part of him “that’s trying to make up for things that I’ve either done or have made people feel. Or affected the kids in any kind of negative way.” Nevertheless, he added: “My kids are amazingly well-adjusted considering some of the things that they’ve been through. I’m very, very proud of all of them. They’ve all stood on their own and done what they believe in.” The interview, a preview of which was sent to media, is the fifth and final instalment of the series. A television version of the interview will air on the BBC on January 31.",2026-01-22T16:20:16.418Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/22/entertainment/phil-collins-health-challenges-scli-intl,Lianne Kolirin,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01kfgb7086nezrqqy98evjr47c.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:20
Celebrities like Pedro Pascal and Billie Eilish begin to condemn deadly shootings in Minneapolis amid ICE surge,"The silence that has largely blanketed Hollywood since the Trump administration deployed thousands of federal agents to Minneapolis appeared to crack this weekend in the wake of the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Two celebrities known for speaking their values — “The Last of Us” star Pedro Pascal and singer Billie Eilish — were among the loudest. Pascal shared multiple posts to his Instagram Sunday night drawing attention to the killing of both Pretti and Renee Good, who was fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis on January 7. One of Pascal’s postsincluded drawings of Pretti and Good with the words “Pretti Good reason for a national strike” along with snippets from a New York Times editorial titled “Two People Are Dead. Americans Deserve to Know the Truth.” Actress Jamie Lee Curtisshared the same image on Instagram.Actor Edward Norton, speaking to the Los Angeles Times at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, alsocalled fora general strike. Writing on Instagram, Pascal said: “Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and authoritarian regime. Mr Pretti and Renee Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.” He also tagged the New York Times. On Instagram, Eilish posted to her stories several times, including one calling Pretti “a real American hero.” Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, wasrepeatedly shotafter being tackled by federal agents in a confrontation caught on video. Eilish called out the overwhelming silence from many of America’s cultural luminaries, posting a selfie with the words: “hey my fellow celebrities u gonna speak up? or” By Monday morning, singer Katy Perry wasurgingher Instagram followers to write to their senators. The slow roll began over the weekend, as Natalie Portman and Olivia Wilde appeared at Sundance wearing pins reading “ICE Out,” which werealso donnedby several actors at the Golden Globes earlier this month. “I could not be prouder to be American right now, by the way the Americans are acting. And I could not be sadder to be American right now with the way the government is behaving,” Portman, whose film “The Gallerist” is opening at the festival, toldDeadline. Speaking on the Sundance red carpet, WildetoldThe Associated Press she was “horrified” by the deaths at the hands of federal agents and that she believed many Americans were as well. “I think it’s appalling,” said Wilde, in Sundance to promote “The Invite,” which she both stars in and directs. “It’s really difficult to be here and to be celebrating something so joyous and beautiful and positive when we know what’s happening on the streets. Americans are out on the streets marching and demanding justice and we’re there with them.” Elsewhere, actors Mark Ruffalo and Glenn Close, no strangers to speaking out, also condemned the violence by federal agents. “Alex Pretti is a hero,” Ruffalowroteon Bluesky, resharing a post about Pretti being a nurse with the Veterans Administration and a dog owner. Prior to thathe also shared a link to the video of Pretti being shot, writing: “Cold blooded murder in the streets of the USA by an occupying military gang, creating havoc. We have fought wars in other countries for less than this.” On Instagram, Closereadfrom prepared remarks, saying that while she has been mostly out of the country since September, she has “watched, with the rest of the world, our democracy being systematically disemboweled and torn apart.” “I am outraged and sickened by what is happening under the Trump regime: the cruelty, inhumanity, and arrogance,” she said. “The voracious corruption, the cowardice, the sickening hypocrisy, the blatant manipulation of facts, and now the cold-blooded murder of American citizens.” Close ended her remarks by saying she believed “the great American body politic is stirring, waking up and taking in what’s going on.” “And, mark my words, there will be hell to pay,” she concluded.",2026-01-26T18:38:08.485Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/entertainment/celebrities-against-ice-immigration-violence-minneapolis,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-12-02t031625z-201890137-rc228iailxn7-rtrmadp-3-film-avatar-premiere.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:31
"The Golden Globes were calm, scripted and largely apolitical amid a world on fire","Perhaps the 83rd Annual Golden Globes decided to lean into dry January. The annual awards show is known for having flowing booze, which often helps lubricate the acceptance speeches, but things were oddly calm this year. Absent were any sloppy moments or off-the-cuff interactions. Winners were also largely quiet on the political situation inside the country, giving the whole thing a muted tone. Has the awards show become more conservative or was Hollywood simply leaning into the joy the world desperately seems to need right now? In the olden days, celebs would wear sunglasses inside the show — more to hide their clear enjoyment of the libations than to look cool. Jack Nicholson was wearing a pair when he announced “I took a valium tonight” back in 2003. A decade later, hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler held their own drinks up to the camera while Fey joked, “Look how drunk Glenn Close is,” as noted in avideoby The Wrap titled “Drunken Globes: One Minute of ‘Golden’ Boozy Moments.” And who can forget Cate Blanchett’sadmissionafter winning best actress in a drama for “Blue Jasmine” in 2014 that since her “category came up rather later in the evening,” she was “a couple of sheets to the wind.” CNN’s Stephanie Elam was in the room Sunday night and said that while she saw a few stars with “wobbly footsteps” towards the end of the show, it was more about folks catching up and making sure to hit the side room for sushi, dessert and cocktails. The muted vibe might track with the turmoil outside the ballroom, as the country reckons with thekillingof Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, President Donald Trump’sassaulton Venezuela and spiralingprotestsin Iran. While some — including Ariana Grande, Natasha Lyonne and Tessa Thompson — wore “Be Good” or “ICE Out” pins in the wake of Good’s killing, statements were relegated to the red carpet. Actor Mark Ruffalo, who was nominated for best male actor in a television drama for his work in “Task,”told USA Todaythat the pin was for Good and “the people in the United States who are terrorized and scared today.” “I know I’m one of ‘em,” he said on the red carpet. “I love this country and what I’m seeing here happening is not America.” “We’re in the middle of a war with Venezuela that we illegally invaded,” said Ruffalo, who is known to use social media to speak his mind about politics. “He’s telling the world that international law doesn’t matter to him.” Asked on the red carpet about shooting the latest season of “Hacks,” Jean Smarttold“Entertainment Tonight” that “everything is a little bit overshadowed with everything that’s going on in our country.” “I feel like we’re kind of at a turning point in our country, and I hope people can keep their heads, because I think that’s actually going to be the hardest thing, to keep our heads,” she said. “But that’s going to take a lot of courage and a lot of restraint, but I think that’s important.” Smart pointed to her words during her acceptance speech after once again winning the best actress in a TV comedy award. “There’s so much that could be said tonight. I said my rant on the red carpet, so I won’t do it here,” she said on stage. “Let’s all do the right thing. I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do, so let’s do the right thing.” Host Nikki Glaser touched on some political issues during her opening monologue, getting in a jab about theEpstein files. “I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight, it’s insane. There’s so many A-listers. And by ‘A-listers’ I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted,” she joked. “Yes and the Golden Globe for best editing goes to … the Justice Department.” She also poked fun at CBS which hosted the show and has been under scrutiny after the new editor-in-chief of CBS News, Bari Weiss,shelveda “60 Minutes” story about Venezuelan men being deported by the Trump administration to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador. “And the award for ‘Most Editing’ goes to CBS News,” Glaser quipped Sunday night. “Yes, CBS News, America’s newest place to see BS news.” It was Glaser’s second time hosting the Golden Globes and like last year she leaned more heavily into teasing the talent and the industry than taking on politics, though even that schtick seemed kinder and gentler. This is a woman who managed to get Sean Penn to laugh at her saying “Everyone in this town is obsessed with looking younger, but Sean Penn is like, ‘What if I slowly morph into a sexy leather handbag?’” Penn is a man who has famously swung at paparazzi for less. One person who spoke their minds from the Beverly Hilton stage was Wanda Sykes while presenting the award for best stand-up comedy on TV to Ricky Gervais for his “Ricky Gervais: Mortality” Netflix special. Gervais was not there to accept the award and Sykes used the opportunity to “thank God and the trans community” on his behalf. Gervais is famously an atheist and has received backlash for comments he’s made about the trans community. For the record, last year’s Golden Globes weren’t super political either, but this year’s felt even more staid and family friendly. One of the most viral moments? “All Her Fault” star Duke McCloud on the red carpet talking about his tiny, tailored blue suit. The awards show may get that Generation Alpha viewership yet.",2026-01-12T17:14:41.556Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/12/entertainment/golden-globes-not-boozy-political,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2255252125-20260112124931534.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:42
Nigella Lawson to replace Prue Leith on ‘The Great British Baking Show’,"Celebrity chefNigella Lawsonis to join “The Great British Baking Show” as a judge, replacing the departingPrue Leith. The move was announced Monday in a statement from Channel 4, which airs the TV baking competition in the United Kingdom. It said it was “delighted to announce” Lawson’s arrival on the show, which is known as “The Great British Bake Off” in the UK. “Nigella’s expertise, empathy and humour are the perfect ingredients for the Bake Off tent,” the statement reads. Lawson said in the same statement that she is “bubbling with excitement” to take up the role, while acknowledging that it is “daunting to be following in the footsteps of Prue Leith and Mary Berry before her, great dames both.” “The Great British Bake Off is more than a television programme, it’s a National Treasure – and it’s a huge honour to be entrusted with it,” she added. Leith said she is “thrilled” that Lawson will take over her role as a judge. “She’s sassy, fun and she knows her onions — and her croissants, cake and crumble,” she said in the statement. Nigella Lawson butters her toast twice, and Britain is really angry about it Lawson, age 66, is herself something of a national treasure in the UK, where she is known to many simply as “Nigella” and credited with bringing new audiences to the world of cooking shows thanks to her flirtatious manner. Born in London, she is the daughter of former Chancellor of the Exchequer — or finance minister — Nigel Lawson. After studying at Oxford University, she began her career in publishing before moving into media, writing restaurant columns. Lawson went on to contribute to various UK newspapers before writing books. In 1998, she brought out “How to Eat,” in which she described how food was one of her earliest loves. Lawson went on to release a string of other successful cookbooks as well as to host numerous cooking shows, such as “Nigella Bites.” She was also a judge on the ABC show “The Taste.”",2026-01-26T15:12:48.193Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/entertainment/nigella-lawson-great-british-baking-show-scli-intl-gbr,Jack Guy,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2214783650.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:50
The legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has a new star and it is Taylor Swift,"The latest round of legal drama between actress Blake Lively and her “It Ends with Us” director Justin Baldoni offers incredible insight into the support network Lively relied on during and after the movie’s production — including one of her good friends, Taylor Swift. According to unsealed documents filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday and obtained by CNN, Lively spoke openly with friends about the trouble she allegedly experienced on the set of the 2024 movie, which she costarred in alongside Baldoni. Lively has accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and coordinating a “plan” to “destroy” her reputation, according to a suit filed against him and his production company, Wayfarer Studios. In one exchange with Swift, with whom she has had a longstanding friendship, Lively referred to Baldoni as her “doofus director,” according to the new filing. A year later, the two women texted about Baldoni again, according to the new filing, this time ahead of a New York Times story that burst open the drama on set for all the public to see. “I think this bitch knows something is coming because he’s gotten out his tiny violin,” Swift texted Lively, along with a screenshot of an Instagram post from People Magazine, highlighting comments from Baldoni about being “sexually traumatized” in his past, according to the legal documents. Swift likened the Lively/Baldoni situation to “a horror film no one knows is taking place,” the documents show. CNN has reached out to Swift’s representative for comment. “The newly unsealed evidence shows the concerns of Ms. Lively and others were documented in real-time as early as Spring 2023, and Wayfarer understood them as ‘sexual harassment’ concerns,” Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively’s legal team, said in a statement to CNN. “The evidence also documents how Wayfarer refused to investigate, but instead attempted to ‘bury’ Ms. Lively and others who spoke up through retaliation,” she said. Asked to comment on McCawley’s statement, Bryan Freedman, a lawyer for Baldoni and Wayfarer, said “the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law. A simple read of the newly released message exchanges make the truth abundantly clear. We remain confident in the legal process and clearing the names of all of the Justin Baldoni parties.” After the New York Times published itsarticle, “’We Can Bury Anyone’: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine,” Baldonifiled suitagainst the newspaper, alleging that the story was “rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions” and relied on Lively’s “self-serving narrative.” The story included contents from a Civil Rights Department complaint, typically kept confidential, that Lively had filed against Baldoni in December 2024 accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation against her. Lively then filed a suit against Baldoni. Baldoni followed with a $400 million suit against Lively and her superstar husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging defamation and that they both “hijacked” his film and were attempting to “destroy” his career. A judgedismissed Baldoni’s suits against Lively and Reynolds, as well as against the New York Times,in June 2025. Two months later, the New York Times filed suit against Wayfarer in an effort to recoup legal fees. In December 2025, Lively’s suit against Baldoni was postponed from a trial date of March 9 to May 18, 2026. Swift’s star power first entered the casein May 2025, when it was revealed that she had been subpoenaedafter text exchanges were revealed to include the name “Taylor” as part of Baldoni’s suit. Baldoni had sought to depose Swift, and requested more time to make that happen,but a judge ruled against it in September 2025. Swift and Lively are known to have had a close friendship and reference is made in the newly unsealed legal documents to the song “My Tears Ricochet” from Swift’s “Folklore” album being used in the “It Ends with Us” trailer. Lively directed the music video for Swift’s song “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)” and the actress and her husband Reynolds frequently socialized with the singer and her now fiancé, NFL player Travis Kelce, including attending his games playing for the Kansas City Chiefs. In November 2024,Reynolds confirmed that Swift is the godmother to his and Lively’s three young daughters— James, Inez and Betty. The couple also have a son, Olin, born in 2023. Swift was not the only one to allegedly complain about Baldoni, the newly unsealed documents show. The legal documents also included what are said to be messages from “It Ends with Us” actress Jenny Slate, who allegedly wrote in one that “this has been a really gross and disturbing shoot, and I’m one of many who feel this way,” about her time spent on set. CNN has reached out to representatives for Slate for comment.

"Remembering Catherine O’Hara, brilliant star of ‘Home Alone’ and ‘Schitt’s Creek’","Catherine O’Hara, the radiant actress whose singular comedic delivery helped elevate movies and TV shows like “Beetlejuice,” “Home Alone” and “Schitt’s Creek” to cult classic status, has died. She was 71. A statement from CAA, the agency that represented O’Hara, said the actress died Friday “at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness.” O’Hara got her start at Second City in her native Canada, before turning to film, where she brought to life two of cinema’s most memorable mothers. In 1988’s “Beetlejuice,” she played Delia Deetz, a devilish mom who made no secret of her love for “Prince Valium” and turnedlip syncinginto an art form. She reprised the role in 2024’s “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.” In 1990’s “Home Alone,” O’Hara turned a one-word movie line (“KEVIN!”) into pop culture history. As a frazzled mom of five who left one of her brood (Macaulay Culkin) at home during their holiday trip to France, O’Hara brought heart and humor to the nowclassic Christmas movie. A sequel was released in 1992. Just two years ago, O’Hara showed up to the Walk of Fame ceremony as her on-screen son Culkin received his star. “Thank you for including me, your fake mom who left you home alone not once, but twice, to share in this happy occasion,” O’Hara told him. “I’m so proud of you.” On Friday, Culkin paid tribute to O’Hara onsocial media, addressing her as “mama.” “I thought we had time,” he wrote. “I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you but I had so much more to say. I love you.” “Home Alone” director Chris Columbus said he was “stunned and heartbroken” by O’Hara’s passing and praised the “profound emotional depth” she brought to the movie. “What most people don’t realize is that Catherine carries the weight of 50% of that film. The movie simply would not work without her extraordinary performance,” he told CNN in a statement. He added: “I will miss her greatly. Yet there is a small sense of comfort, realizing that two of the finest human beings I’ve ever known, Catherine and John Candy, are together again, brilliantly improvising, making each other laugh.” Candy had a part in the movie, playing a traveling musician whose band helps O’Hara’s character get home to her child. After the success of “Home Alone,” she turned to collaborating with director Christopher Guest, starring in many of his iconic mockumentaries, including “Waiting for Guffman” (1996) and “Best in Show” (2000). “I am devastated,” Guest told CNN in a statement. “We have lost one of the comic giants of our age.” In those films, O’Hara worked often alongside Eugene Levy, becoming a signature duo who went on to co-star in the acclaimed series “Schitt’s Creek” together. As wayward posh actress Moira Rose, O’Hara’s one-liners were meme gold and earned her critical praise. O’Hara won an Emmy in 2020 during a Covid-era ceremony that saw stars masked up and celebrating while scattered across the globe, with the action captured on 130 dispatched cameras. In her speech, O’Hara thanked creators Eugene and Dan Levy for “bestowing me the opportunity to play a woman of a certain age, my age, who gets to fully be her ridiculous self.” On Friday evening, Dan Levy wrote on Instagram that O’Hara and his father spent over 50 years collaborating, so he counted her as “extended family before she ever played my family.” “It’s hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her,” he wrote. O’Hara also won a Golden Globe for her performance on the show in 2021. “Moira’s way more interesting than I am,” she once told the New York Times. “And the fun thing about her was that she was an actor, so I could, once in a while, get to perform or get to do an accent. Once you’ve had that in your life, it’s really hard to give up.” Most recently, O’Hara played a fallen executive in “The Studio,” for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. She also appeared in a critical role in Season 2 of HBO Max’s “The Last of Us,” for which she was also nominated for an Emmy.

"From ‘The Big Chill’ to ‘Inception,’ here are the 25 films added to the National Film Registry this year","While President Donald Trump is pushing Americans to see his wife’s documentary “Melania” which premieres this week, the Library of Congress is reminding us that the country’s cinematic history is vast and well worth celebrating. The body on Thursday released its annual list of films added to the National Film Registry “due to their cultural, historic or aesthetic importance to preserve the nation’s film heritage.” The Library named 25 films in total, dating from 1896 to 2014. The list includes classics from the ’80s and ’90’s, including “The Big Chill,” “The Karate Kid,” “Philadelphia” and “Before Sunrise,” as well as newer fare like “Inception” and “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” No one tell the president that the 1992 comedy “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,” in which he famously makes a cameo, did not make the cut. The Library of Congress National Film Registry was established by Congress when the National Film Preservation Act was passed in 1988. The selections for 2025 bring the number of titles in the registry to 925. Wes Anderson, who directed “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” said the Library of Congress inspired his film’s visual style. “When we were first starting to try to figure out, how do we tell this story… the architecture and the landscapes… they don’t exist anymore,”Anderson said in a statement to NPR.“We just went through the entire photocrom collection, which is a lot of images. And …we made our own versions of things, but much of what is in our film comes directly - with our little twist on it - from that collection, from the library, the Library of Congress.” Trump has targeted the Library of Congress in his desire to overhaul the government. In May 2025,he firedthe long-serving Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who still had about a year and a half left in her 10-year term. Later that year,the Supreme Court stopped Trump, at least temporarily, from replacing a top official at the Library of Congress, Shira Perlmutter, the director of the US Copyright Office. The films added by the Library of Congress to the National Film Registry for 2025 are:",2026-01-29T16:43:45.026Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/entertainment/library-congress-national-film-registry,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/msdphil-ec002.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:30:19
Bowen Yang describes what it was like exiting ‘Saturday Night Live’: ‘I stayed on exactly as long as I wanted to’,"If you thought Bowen Yang was overbeing emotional about leaving “Saturday Night Live,”you would be mistaken. The now former “SNL” cast member gave the exit interview we all definitely needed when he talked about his experienceon the latest episode of “Las Culturistas,”the podcast he co-hosts with his best friend Matt Rogers. Rogers began in the episode, titled “Exit Interview (The Cathartic Episode),” by joking that anyone who didn’t know that Yang had left the long-running NBC sketch show after seven and a half years must be living under “not even a rock, a boulder, a big rock.” Yang said it was “time,” and that prior to the pandemic and the “the current media landscape,” seven years was usually the time most cast members would head off for other pastures. “In a lot of cases (cast members) don’t have the like, privilege of staying on as long as they would like to,” he said. “I have this very beautiful thing where I get to say that I stayed on exactly as long as I wanted to.” “It’s like landing the Mars rover on like a square foot of terrain,” Yang said of his last “SNL” appearance on December 20, which saw him engaging in sketches with the evening’s host – and his “Wicked” costar – Ariana Grande, along with one final sketch that involved the night’s musical guest Cher. “It was like, there were no guarantees about how any of it was gonna shake out.” Listeners of the podcast also learned some life lessons via Yang on “SNL,” including that “working there is just making peace with the fact that like, things are completely out of your control. Down to the audience response to a joke,” he shared. “Nothing is guaranteed. Like that is sort of it in a nutshell,” Yang said. “It kind of is perfectly illustrative of what that job is. And it was resonant all the way through to the end. And I feel really – this word is meaningless I think maybe now – but so grateful.” Bowen Yang tearfully bids farewell to ‘Saturday Night Live’ with the help of Cher and Ariana Grande His cohost disagreed that it was meaningless, given that “there probably were so many times during that experience where you didn’t know if you were going to be able to end the experience of working there with gratitude.” “So many different people havemany different kinds of experiencesleaving that show,” Rogers added. “You come in and there is a shared experience of being at ‘SNL,’ but then ultimately it comes down to, there’s like a collectivism there, but there’s an individualism in terms of like, everyone is on their own journey there,” Yang agreed. “Everyone has a different length of their tenure, completely different struggles.” But there was clearly a lot of joy too, as Yang talked about the blessing of working on a show where one could go from having an idea early in the week and have it on the air that weekend. Plus the idea of not having to necessarily learn lines, as there were cue cards. All things he said were not transferable experiences to most other TV shows. Regarding the final sketch where he played a Delta One employee working his last shift, Yang said he cried during the table read the Wednesday prior and admitted that it was “completely self-indulgent” to be able to have the character say goodbye – something other former cast members didn’t get. He then got emotional recalling how people showed up for him during his final sketch, including his friend and former “SNL” co-cast member Aidy Bryant who left the show in 2022 after a decade, along with many who worked behind the scenes. “I get on the floor, I look out, and it was like basically everyone who worked there was off the floor showing up,” he said on the podcast, tearfully. “And I just looked out and I thought, I’m so lucky that I ever got to work here. And I’m so lucky that I get to make this little statement that’s barely veiled, where I’m like, ‘I love you all.’” Yang is not the only longtime cast member who has been reflecting on leaving the legendary show. Ego Nwodim also recently left after seven seasons, andlast weekend talked to E! on the Critics Choice Awardsred carpet about it. “I got to be part of such an incredible ensemble. I learned so much,” she said. “Then, I wanted to take those skills that I learned and cultivated there and see what else I can do.”",2026-01-08T20:31:00.694Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/entertainment/bowen-yang-exiting-snl,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2252354713.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:30:31

The first ‘Battle’ for award show domination is won and other takeaways from the 2026 Golden Globes,"Toward the end of the evening, Julia Roberts claimed it had been “a beautiful night to be an artist,” and that was very much the case – even if the reality of the outside world didn’t quite break into the room like it sometimes does. It was an unforgettable night for many, including 11 actors and one director who took home their very first Golden Globes, according to the organization. Let the battle to upset “One Battle After Another’s” award season momentum begin. The acclaimed film from director Paul Thomas Anderson scooped up four awards on Sunday, earning the award for best musical or comedy film, as well as a best supporting actress in a motion picture win for Teyana Taylor. Anderson also picked up two individual honors, one for best director and one for best screenplay. The Globe wins were the first for the “Phantom Thread” director, who was previously nominated for writing 2021’s “Licorice Pizza.” Anderson – an 11-time Academy Award-nominee – also directed awards darling “There Will Be Blood,” as well as acclaimed ’90s titles “Boogie Nights” and “Magnolia.” But could this year be his to finally pick up an Oscar? The signs are looking good so far. Not only do the four statues bode well for the film’s future, but the room buzzed with good will for Anderson, who didn’t try to hide his glee. While accepting the honor for best director, his second award of the evening, Anderson said, “You guys are being so generous with this affection for me and this film, and I’ll take it. I’ll take it with the love that it’s given and the appreciation.” “One Battle After Another” stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a washed up revolutionary who finds himself facing off against nefarious entities led by a frightening colonel (Sean Penn). Both DiCaprio and Penn were also nominated at the Globes this year, along with newcomer Chase Infiniti, who played DiCaprio’s on-screen daughter, and an uproarious Benicio del Toro in the role of a well-connected karate teacher. The film was also up for best original score. One question that seemed to dominate conversation on Sunday had nothing to do with the genre-scrambling film’s Oscar chances, but, rather, its categorization as a comedy in the first place, which is a whole other can of worms. Those who have seen “One Battle After Another” — an edge-of-your-seat thriller/political manifesto — probably wouldn’t immediately put it in a “comedy or musical” category, but the Globes gonna Globe. This year was no exception. This is, of course, a problem unique to this show as it makes a distinction between drama and comedy/musical categories – something that has long caused many to scratch heads, particularly among film honorees. Presenter Judd Apatow took a long moment on stage to talk about his “beef” with the Globes stemming from this very issue. In 2015, the Ridley Scott-directed sci-fi odyssey “The Martian” ended up in the best musical or comedy category and beat out Apatow’sactualcomedy “Trainwreck,” starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. “You know Ridley Scott – America’s favorite comedy director. Director of such hilarious comedies as ‘Gladiator,’ ‘Blade Runner’ and ‘Alien,’” Apatow joked on stage. The category confusion continued this year. Rose Byrne, who won in the best female actor for a musical or comedy category for the harrowing film “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” – a portrait of an extremely overextended mother brought to the brink – noted during her acceptance speech that she “didn’t sing” in the role. One thing the Globes can say: its polarizing box office achievement category – frustrating as some might find it that a Netflix movie with a limited theatrical run (“KPop Demon Hunters”) was nominated alongside a movie that earned the distinction before it even hit theaters (“Avatar: Fire and Ash”) – did work as intended, withbox office behemoth “Sinners”taking home the statue. So maybe there is –sometimes– a method to the madness. Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser’s monologue was as self aware as they come, with the night’s emcee joking that the show was “without a doubt the most important thing happening in the world right now.” And that’s about as political as the ceremony got for quite a while. Though some years past have been ripe with political commentary on stage, the topic was notably absent this year, with speech givers opting to shout-out their families and people inside the Globes ballroom as opposed to the weighty issues outside of it. The red carpet was a slightly different story. Several celebrities including Mark Ruffalo and Jean Smart wore “Be Good” pins in support of Renee Nicole Good, the Minnesota mother who wasshot and killed by ICE agentslast week. Smart, who won a Globe for best actress in a musical or comedy, later spoke toExtraabout her decision to make a political statement at an award show, saying that she understands why people may not always want to hear what celebrities have to say about what’s going on in the world. “I have mixed feelings about, you know, getting political or making social commentary at an awards event,” she said, later adding that she feels “we’ve gotten to a point now that is so important that everybody wakes up and opens their eyes, and is brave and calm, but at the same time try to be active.” “Go with your conscience and stay involved,” she said. “Adolescence” writer Jack Thorne also touched on social commentary during his acceptance speech, saying that “removing hate is our generation’s responsibility.” “It requires thought from the top down,” he added. “The possibility seems remote now, but hope is a beautiful thing.” And while presenting the award for best director, Apatow quipped that “we’re in a dictatorship now,” but immediately lightened the tone by joking that he was mostly focused on seeking justice for his film’s loss ten years ago. The evening on the TV side was largely predictable, with Noah Wyle winning best actor in a TV drama for “The Pitt” and Jean Smart winning the Globe for best actress in a TV comedy for “Hacks,” a role for which she also won in 2022 and 2025. One first-time winner did squeeze into the lineup, however: Rhea Seehorn, who took home her first-ever Globe for her performance in the Apple TV sci-fi drama “Pluribus,” a surprising moment in the night’s TV realm considering she went up against Hollywood vets including Kathy Bates and Helen Mirren. During her speech, she thanked “Pluribus” creator Vince Gilligan – who also created “Better Call Saul,” on which Seehorn starred – for “writing me the role of a lifetime.” As for other first-time winners, the night was kicked off on an emotional note thanks to “One Battle” standout Taylor, who won for her role as the fierce Perfidia Beverly Hills. In her teary acceptance speech, Taylor addressed her “brown sisters and (the) little brown girls watching tonight,” saying “our softness is not a liability.” “Our depth is not debt, it’s not too much,” she said. “Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space.” Other notable speeches included Timothée Chalamet’s, who last year openly admitted he wanted to be “one of the greats” while on an awards podium. When he again found himself in the limelight on Sunday after winning the award for best male actor in a musical or comedy for his role as a ping pong prodigy in “Marty Supreme,” he chose a somewhat humbler tone in his acceptance speech, sharing a life lesson that his father taught him. “My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up. Always be grateful for what you have. It’s allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty handed with my head held high, grateful just to be here,” Chalamet said. “I’d be lying if I didn’t say those moments didn’t make this moment that much sweeter.” Speaking of speeches, we heard several from the stars of “Adolescence” — three to be exact, after the series’ stars Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Dougherty all took home awards in their respective categories. It does at this point sort of feel like we’ve been watching these actors win awards for this show forever though, so it’s worth noting that tonight may be the night that concludes the “Adolescence” victory lap in the show’s hugely successful award circuit run. One person who me may see next year? Sophomore Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser, whose searing opening monologue had everyone from Leonardo DiCaprio to Julia Roberts taking jabs in stride.

There’s new ‘toxic mom group’ drama starring Ashley Tisdale and Hilary Duff’s husband,"Beef looks a little different these days for some former teen actors from the early 2000s. Along with the return of low rise jeans and trucker hats, the world can also now revel in what appears to be drama between two former Disney channel stars. It all publicly started whenThe Cut published a personal essay from actress Ashley Tisdalelast week titled “Breaking Up With My Toxic Mom Group.” The star, known for her work on “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody” and the “High School Musical” franchise, wrote about how she and some friends had formed a group chat to talk about being new moms, after all being “pregnant through the early pandemic” and missing out “on the activities where you meet other expectant mothers.” Through the chat and the playdates it spawned, Tisdale initially believed she had found her “village,” she wrote. At some point, she “began to wonder whether that was really true.” “I remember being left out of a couple of group hangs, and I knew about them because Instagram made sure it fed me every single photo and Instagram Story,” she wrote. “Another time, at one of the mom’s dinner parties, I realized where I sat with her — which was at the end of the table, far from the rest of the women. I was starting to feel frozen out of the group, noticing every way that they seemed to exclude me.” She recalled other times being left out and feeling distanced from the group, all of which made her wonder “Why me?” “The truth is, I don’t know and I probably never will. What I do know is that it took me back to an unpleasant but familiar feeling I thought I’d left behind years ago,” she wrote. “Here I was sitting alone one night after getting my daughter to bed, thinking,Maybe I’m not cool enough?All of a sudden, I was in high school again, feeling totally lost as to what I was doing ‘wrong’ to be left out.” Quicker than you could say “MomTok”(which has its own drama), internet sleuths quickly deduced by combing social media that said mom group included fellow actresses and child stars Hilary Duff and Mandy Mooreas well as some other high profile women living in Los Angeles. Then Duff’s husband, singer/songwriter Matthew Koma, metaphorically entered the chat. On Tuesday, Koma took to Instagram stories to post a photo of himself made to look like Tisdale’s photo in her Cut essay using the outlet’s logo and a fake headline reading “When You’re The Most Self Obsessed Tone Deaf Person On Earth, Other Moms Tend To Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.” He added a subheadline that read “A Mom Group Tell All Through A Father’s Eyes” and included as a caption “Read my new interview with @TheCut.” Duff, who starred in Disney Channel’s hit series “Lizzie McGuire” as a teen, married Koma, who is in the band Winnetka Bowling League, in 2019 and they are the parents of three young daughters. She also shares a son with her ex-husband Mike Comrie. Tisdale’s essay for The Cut is not her first on the subject to go viral. In December 2025,a post on her blog headlined “You’re Allowed to Leave Your Mom Group”under her married name, Ashley French, stirred conversation on social media. CNN has reached out to reps for Tisdale, Duff, Koma and Moore for comment.",2026-01-07T16:01:00.782Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/07/entertainment/ashley-tisdale-hilary-duff-husband-toxic-mom-group,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20260107-tisdale.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:31:07
"2026 Movie Preview: Get ready for superheroes, sequels… and an epic ‘Odyssey’","Theever-endangered movie theateris making another strong bid for your IRL attendance in 2026. Many of the year’s most anticipated films are, unsurprisingly, sequels or updates to prior beloved material, with a few breaths of fresh air in the mix for good measure. Here’s a taste of what our collective cinematic future holds: Ralph Fiennes’ surprisingly genteel post-apocalyptic doctor returns in this fourth “28 Days Later” installment, conceivably picking up shortly after the rather bonkers ending of last year’s “28 Years Later.” Expect more naked zombies. If the excessive strobe lights in the trailer haven’t put you off, this (we think) concert mockumentary covering Charli XCX’s “brat” tour might finally be the movie worthy of following in the footsteps of Madonna’s “Truth or Dare.” From Emerald Fennell, the director of “Promising Young Woman,” this Emily Brontë adaptation out just in time for Valentine’s Day bursts its bodice in the trailer alone, featuring smoldering, scandalous looks shared between Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. Co-produced by basketball great Stephen Curry, this animated underdog movie introduces us to Will Harris (voiced by“Stranger Things” starCaleb McLaughlin), a goat hoping to become a GOAT in the sport of roarball. “White Lotus”Season 3 MVP Sam Rockwelltakes us on a madcap journey into a terrifying future that seemingly starts at famed Los Angeles diner chain Norms, where he goes looking for people to help him save the world. Costars include fellow “White Lotus” alum Haley Lu Richardson, and Zazie Beetz. Maggie Gyllenhaal directs “Hamnet” star Jessie Buckley as the Bride of Frankenstein and Christian Bale as Frankenstein’s monster in a film that looks like it’s as far away from the classic Universal monster movies from days of yore as possible. Look for Maggie’s brother (and “Donnie Darko” costar) Jake Gyllenhaal in an as-yet-unspecified role. After last year’s much-talked-about “It Ends With Us,” the next Colleen Hoover novel to get the movie adaptation treatment tells the story of a woman (“It Follows” star Maika Monroe) searching for redemption after a prison sentence. “Gilmore Girls” alum Lauren Graham, “The Handmaid’s Tale” actor Bradley Whitford, and Tyriq Withers of “Him” fame all co-star. From “The Martian” writer Andy Weir comes a newsci-fi epic, this one based on his 2021 novel about a science teacher (Ryan Gosling) who wakes up on a spaceship to find himself in an unbelievable predicament. Zendaya and Robert Pattinson star as a soon-to-be-wed couple who encounter copious amounts of the title subject in this different looking rom-com. Following the massive success of 2023’s first film, Chris Pratt is back as Mario for a new adventure alongside Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser and more, including new cast addition Brie Larson as the voice of Rosalina. Let’s-a go! “The Little Mermaid’s” Halle Bailey and “Bridgerton” star Regé-Jean Page team up for this spicy-looking rom-com that feels like an “Under the Tuscan Sun” for the youngsters. The Michael Jackson biopic from Antoine Fuqua of “Training Day” fame follows the King of Pop’s rise to the top, and stars Jackson’s nephew Jaafar Jackson in the title role. This one is sure to be a talker for several reasons, not the least of which being that the film’s productionreportedly ran into a major roadblockwith the script that delayed the film’s release. Time is moving at a glacial pace as fans of the 2006 filmawait this sequel. Returning cast members including Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are joined by franchise newcomers Justin Theroux, Kenneth Branagh and Lady Gaga. This new entry in the storied universe will welcome sci-fi queen Sigourney Weaver to the franchise. She plays a colonel who sends the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and Grogu – formerly known as the Child orBaby Yoda– on a new mission to the Outer Rim. A Steven Spielberg alien extravaganza released in summer? Pinch me! This one, starring Emily Blunt, is Spielberg’s first feature since 2022’s “Fabelmans” and his first sci-fi-leaning movie since “Ready Player One” in 2018. Is the age of toys really over? That isthe fateful questionseemingly posed by this new Pixar installment, which picks up on the familiar parenting conundrum about screentime as Woody, Buzz and the gang encounter a new doohickey in the playroom – a tablet. Milly Alcock stars as the Man of Steel’s cousin, an unruly intergalactic renegade (and actual owner of Krypto the Superdog, as seen in her“Superman” cameo). Directed by Christopher Nolan, this epic based on the monumental poem by Homer is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, with a cast of truly mythic proportions: Matt Damon, Anne Hathaway, Charlize Theron, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Robert Pattinson, Elliot Page and Lupita Nyong’o costar. Speaking of Tom Holland and Zendaya, two weeks after they embark on their odyssey, they return for a fourth go-round in Marvel’s Spider-Man franchise, seemingly setting the scene for “Doomsday,” out later in the year. Let the sequel festivities continuewith this updateto the beloved 1998 witch movie starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman as sisters who each take a very different approach to their familial gifts. Dianne West and Stockard Channing are back as their meddling aunts Jet and Franny, respectively, with Lee Pace and “Game of Thrones” star Maisie Williams joining the fun. Tom Cruise teams with “Revenant” and “Birdman” director Alejandro G. Iñárritu for this dark comedy following the most powerful man in the world, who has some truly destructive tricks up his sleeve. Directed by Aaron Sorkin – who wrote and won an Oscar forthe script for 2010’s groundbreaking David Fincher movie “The Social Network” – this followup takes another look at the society-shaping social media platform, this time with “Succession” and “Apprentice” star Jeremy Strong in the role of Mark Zuckerberg. Also starring last year’s best actress Oscar-winnerMikey Madison. Thisnew installmentin the film franchise based on the bestselling YA book series by Suzanne Collins again dials things back, this time looking at Haymitch Abernathy’s origins. Haymitch, portrayed as a middle-age adult in earlier films by Woody Harrelson, will be portrayed in this prequel by newcomer Joseph Zada. Jennifer Lawrence is expected to (at least briefly) reprise her role as Katniss Everdeen. Just in time for Thanksgiving, more awkward family shenanigans will ensue when the son (Skyler Gisondo) of Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam Focker (Teri Polo) brings home his fiancée (Ariana Grande) to, well, meet the parents. Santa (“Stranger Things” actor David Harbour) is back for more bloody holiday fun in “Violent Night 2,” a follow-up to the 2022 original. If theabsolutely stacked castof this MCU mashup of the X-Men and Avengers didn’t feel quite stacked enough,Disney recently revealedvia a new teaser that the movie will also feature the return of Chris Evans as Captain America. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya (who is particularly busy this year, as seen above) return for the next installment of this epic science fiction franchise, directed by Denis Villeneuve, based on the Frank Herbert book series. Like 2024’s “Nosferatu,” director Robert Eggers will be bringing us a peculiar Christmas gift with his new take on the classic werewolf story.

Noah Wyle promised Season 2 of ‘The Pitt’ was going to get ‘complicated.’ He wasn’t exaggerating,"Season 2 of “The Pitt” has officially begun, showcasing another 15-hour day in the life of the emergency department staff at Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. The premiere was as chaotic as we’ve come to expect from the Emmy-winning series. This season centers on belovedDr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch(Noah Wyle) clocking in for his last shift before taking a three-month sabbatical and the return of Dr. Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball) after he’s spent some time in a rehab center the drug addiction. It all takes place on the backdrop of the 4th of July, a notoriously grisly holiday in emergency rooms across the country. “We wanted to have a busy shift,” Wyle told CNN recently. “We wanted to have a holiday weekend. We wanted to explore all the different ways Americans can hurt themselves while they celebrate their independence.” Wyle promised that with these dynamics at play, the new season was going to be as “complicated” as ever. And it delivered. The premiere picked up 10 months after the events of Season 1, during which a mass casualty event unfolded in the final episodes. Dr. Robby started his day by training his replacement – a new by-the-book attending named Dr. Baran Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi), who wastes no time telling him that she wants to launch a campaign “to eradicate” referring to the emergency department as “the Pitt.” Dr. Al-Hashimi comes from a hospital that does not typically handle trauma cases and tries to put in place new protocols that Dr. Robby bristles at, clearly bothered by how quickly they’re being implemented. The two are seen trying to navigate different leadership styles, down to where they’re supposed to stand. It was awkward and clearly it is going to be a long 15 hours for them both. The episode ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, with Dr. Al-Hashimi freezing up after receiving updated medical information about an infant that she was treating with Dr. Mohan (Supriya Ganesh). Elsewhere, Dr. Langdon’s first day back was emotionally loaded. His colleagues were largely welcoming, but his presence earned him an uncomfortable glance from Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones), who last season sounded the alarm to hospital leadership about his addiction. There were other storylines teed up in the premiere, like Dr. Santos taking on a potential child abuse case and Dr. Melissa “Mel” King (Taylor Deardon) stressed out over a lawsuit. Wyle – who also serves as a writer, director and an executive producer on the series – said it was important for the show to address all aspects of the healthcare system this season. “I feel an incredible responsibility,” he said. “Not only to depicting what the healthcare system looks like to its minutiae but also the emotional toll that it takes on the practitioners and the providers who work within it.” New episodes of “The Pitt” are released weekly on Thursdays on HBO Max, which shares a parent company with CNN.",2026-01-09T14:01:11.983Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/09/entertainment/the-pitt-season-2-noah-wyle,Alli Rosenbloom,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/noah-wyle-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:31:32
The iPhone 17 is easing Wall Street’s concerns about Apple’s AI troubles,"As Big Techbattles for dominance in artificial intelligence, Apple is flying high on the success of the iPhone. The company reported earnings that blew past Wall Street’s expectations on Thursday, largely driven by the iPhone 17. Revenue hit $143.8 billionfor the quarter, up from $124.3 billion a year ago. Meanwhile,iPhone revenue reached $85.3 billion compared to analysts’ expectation of$78.2 billion for the quarter. The results capture the first full quarter of availability for the iPhone 17, which came out in September. And the stakes were high: Apple has been widely perceived as behind in AI, putting more pressure on core products like the iPhone to succeed. Apple (AAPL) also announced that there are now 2.5 billion Apple devices in use globally. CEO Tim Cook told analysts on Thursday that the company saw record iPhone upgradesand double-digit growth on “switchers,” users who switch from Android to the iPhone. Revenue in China, a market where Apple has struggled, also grew to $25.5 billion for the quarter compared to $18.5 billion a year ago. “The demand for iPhone was simply staggering,” Cook said. The results come after a challenging 2025 for Apple. Last year, the company grappled with tariffs and a high-profile delay of its revamped version of Siri, which Cook said on the call will arrive this year. Apple and Google recently announced that the search giant’s AI and cloud technology will power the iPhone maker’s AI models, including the upcoming Siri. Despite the strong results, Apple still has hurdles ahead. Manufacturers arepivoting resources to creating memory for data centers rather than consumer products like smartphones,creating a memory shortagein the tech industry. Cook said that Apple is currently “constrained” and that it’s “difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance.” He added that the memory shortage had a “minimal impact” on the December quarter but might be more noticeable in the current quarter. The iPhone 17 lineup has been broadly successful, butdemand for the iPhone Airhas been muted, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. And while the partnership with Google signals that Apple is making progress in AI, it’ll still face pressure to show how it will use AI in new products. When asked about when Apple plans to make money off AI, Cook said that AI “opens up a range of opportunities” across Apple’s “products and services.” He added that the company is “very happy” with its arrangement with Google. Apple didn’t share more about the partnership, whichCook said should be viewed as a “collaboration.”",2026-01-29T23:07:22.257Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/tech/apple-earnings-iphone-17-sales-ai,Lisa Eadicicco,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256863144.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:17
"People aren’t buying into Apple’s big bet on a slimmer iPhone, survey suggests","Apple bet big ona dramatic redesignof its iPhone last year, thebiggest shakeup to its flagship smartphone in nearly a decade. But the slimmer iPhone Air hasn’t seemed to resonate with buyers. New market research data indicates iPhone Air adoption lags far behind the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max: Just 6% of US iPhone shoppers surveyed by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners purchased the iPhone Air in the quarter ending in December, the phone’s first full quarter of availability. By comparison, 22% bought the regular iPhone 17; 25% bought the iPhone 17 Pro; and 27% chose the pricey iPhone 17 Pro Max, according to the report. The numbers were shared with CNN ahead of their release on Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) is set to report earnings on Thursday afternoon and will announce global iPhone revenue for the quarter. But it doesn’t break out numbers for specific iPhone models. There have already been reports ofweak demandfor the iPhone Air. But Apple, the world’s largest smartphone makerby someestimates, might not need a smash hit. TheInternational Data Corporationforecast a record number of shipments this year for Apple driven by its latest iPhone 17 lineup. And some analysts say the iPhone Air was never really intended to be a bestseller. Instead, the phone was meant to add more variety for buyers and set the stage for more advanced  iPhones, such as models that fold in half. The iPhone Air is Apple’s attempt to make smartphones exciting again Still, the iPhone Air’s frosty reception raisesquestions about how Apple can evolve beyond the tried-and-true iPhone lineup: the standard, Pro and Pro Max models. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding iPhone Air sales, launch plans for a future version or changes to production plans. The new data from CIRP indicates a sizable gap in interest between the Air and the rest of Apple’s latest iPhones. The report is based on a survey conducted between January 2 and 21 of 500 US consumers who purchased an Apple product between October and December 2025. It’s not the first indication of sluggish demand for the iPhone Air, which was released in September, at the same time as the iPhone 17 models.The Informationreported in November that Apple is delaying the second-generation model after sales failed to meet expectations. Apple reportedly cut production of the iPhone Air last fall and ramped up orders for the other models, according toNikkei Asian Review. There may be asimple reason why consumers aren’t interested in the iPhone Air, according to Josh Lowitz, one of the CIRP analysts behind the study: People don’t care about thin phones. Most respondents who bought the iPhone Air did so because they were replacing an old phone, not because they wanted a thinner phone, Lowitz said. Carolina Milanesi, president and principal analyst for tech industry analysis firm Creative Strategies, agrees. Consumers aren’t going into stores saying, “Oh my god, I wish this was lighter,” Milanesi said. “We are used to carrying what we carry. So it wasn’t a problem per se.” Phones might get pricier next year. Thank the AI boom Apple has struggled to find a fourth iPhone model that resonates strongly with consumers. It previously offered smaller and larger versions of the standard iPhone, called the iPhone Mini and iPhone Plus respectively. But Apple scrapped both of those from its lineup after reportedly weak demand. The iPhone Air doesn’t outshine the rest of the lineup in any area but thinness. The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the largest screen, longest-lasting battery and a camera with three lenses. The iPhone 17 Pro is cheaper and smaller than the Pro Max and shares many of its other features. The iPhone 17 is the least expensive of the bunch but still has an additional camera and longer battery life compared to the Air, although Apple’s thinner phone has a larger screen and more powerful chip. “The 17 Pro, Pro Max and the base 17 cover a lot of the features,” CIRP analyst Michael Levin said. “And they kind of suck a lot of the oxygen out of the room.” Some analysts like Milanesi saythe iPhone Air is about much more than short-term sales. The newdesign and engineering changes could pave the way for a foldable iPhone, whichBloomberg reportscould arrive this year. Unlike other models, the chips that power the iPhone Air are embedded in the camera module near the top of the device, allowing more space in the main body for the battery. That enables Apple to achieve a slimmer design without compromising much on battery life. Such a change could be important for a future foldable iPhone considering those types of phones tend to be thicker than regular smartphones when closed. Samsung’s biggest new phone in years may launch in the US this year Devices with innovative designs such as the iPhone Air and foldable phones typically appeal to early adopters rather than the average consumer. Even though that audience represents a small slice of the smartphone market, it’s an important market for Apple to capture, said Milanesi. It’s a key part of how Apple portrays itself as being on the cutting edge of design and technology. “I might not buy the Air but still think that Apple is the best company because they brought the Air,” said Milanesi. “So there’s that halo that you get from a brand perspective.”",2026-01-28T14:00:58.834Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/28/tech/iphone-air-new-apple-17,Lisa Eadicicco,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25252694820340.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:24
"Amazon is laying off 16,000 employees as AI battle intensifies","Amazon is laying off 16,000 employees, the company’ssecond round of large-scale jobreductions in three months as it fights to improve its standing in the battle for AI supremacy. In ablog postWednesday, the company said it needed to reduce red tape to increase its decision-making speed. “We’ve been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy,” said Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people. Amazonin late October announced it was cutting 14,000 corporate employees, following a directive from CEO Andy Jassy’s vision of operating like the world’s biggest startup. He wants the company to remain nimble so it can adapt and change quickly asAI upends the technology sector. Amazon is America’s second-largest private employer, behind Walmart. It has over 350,000 corporate employees, according to a 2024surveyfiled to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The culmination of both the recent rounds of cuts represent about 9% of the company’s overall office staff. Galetti said in the blog post that the waves of layoffs won’t become a “new rhythm,” even though Jassy predicted Amazon would continue to reduce its employment rollsbecause of AI. Instead, Amazon is evaluating the “ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate,” Galetti said. She added, however, that Amazon will hire strategically to ramp up in parts of the business that are critical to the company’s future. Amazon is in stiff competition with Microsoft, Google, Meta, OpenAI and a host of other technology companies that are battling to ramp up computing power and large language models that they believe will power the economy of the future. That’s an expensive endeavor, but Jassy has said these layoffs are about efficiency rather than cost savings. Layoffs will begin Wednesday across the company. Most employees will be given 90 days to look for new roles internally, while people who aren’t rehired at Amazon will be given severance pay and additional benefits, the company said. The layoffs werereportedlyannounced to staff Tuesday night in an internal email. That memo was apparently sent inadvertently, because it referred to the blog post that wasn’t published until Wednesday morning. Amazon separately announced Tuesday it wouldclose its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Gogrocery businesses, as it doubles down on its Whole Foods branded stores. Jassy has been outspoken about AI’s impact on Amazon. Last year, he wrote in a blog post to employees that efficiency gains from the technology would allow the company to reduce its workforce. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he bluntly admitted. Jassy said Amazon wasn’t unique in that respect: He envisioned billions of AI agents being put into service across every company and field. “Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast,” Jassy said. Despite the angst that AI is taking white-collar jobs, the fear that it’s broadly happening is overblown, according to areport from Vanguard. In fact, jobs that are highly exposed to AI automation are growing faster than they did prior to the pandemic – even faster than all other occupations, the investment firm recently said. The findings don’t necessarily signal an all-clear for workers worried about AI disrupting their careers. Some companies have recently reported they’re eliminating some positions because AI can automate entry-level workers’ tasks or make current workers more efficient. Yet there’s no evidence the technology is doing widespread damage, at least not yet. This story has been updated with additional developments and context.",2026-01-28T10:59:58.410Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/28/tech/amazon-layoffs-ai,Jordan Valinsky,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2194916913.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:33
"Meta and YouTube head to trial to defend against youth addiction, mental health harm claims","For years, social media giants have argued against claims that their platforms harm young people’s mental health. Starting Tuesday, they will for the first time have to defend against those claims before a jury in a court of law. A 19-year-old, identified as KGM, and her mother, Karen Glenn, sued TikTok, Meta, Snap and Google’s YouTube, alleging that the companies knowingly created addictive features that harmed her mental health and led to self-harm and suicidal thoughts. TikTok agreed to settle the case under undisclosed terms one day beforethe suit was set to go totrial, according to the plaintiff’s attorney Mark Lanier.Snap settled last week under undisclosed terms. Parents, advocates, health experts,tech whistleblowersandteens themselveshave for years worried that that social media platforms can get young people hooked on scrolling, enable bullying, disrupt their sleep and send them downharmful content rabbit holes. Tech executives have repeatedly been hauled before Congress, at one point even apologizing to parents who say their children died or were harmed because of social media. But the companies have nonetheless faced few consequences or regulationsin the United States. KGM’s case seeks unspecified monetary damages. The outcome could influence how more than 1,000 similar personal injury cases against Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube are resolved. Lanier told CNN he hopes the Snap and TikTok settlements in the KGM case could set the stage for the companies to settle the other cases. Top executives from Meta, TikTok and YouTube are expected to take the witness stand during the trial, which takes place in Los Angeles and is set to last several weeks. In recent years, TikTok, Meta, YouTube and Snap have rolled out safety features and policies, as well as parental control tools, that they say protect young users. The four social media companies are involved in other cases this year as well, including some brought by school districts and state attorneys general. Losses could put the tech companies on the hook for billions of dollars in damages and force them to change their platforms. “For parents whose children have been exploited, groomed, or died because of big tech platforms, the next six weeks are the first step toward accountability after years of being ignored by these companies,” said Sarah Gardner, CEO of the non-profit Heat Initiative, which advocates for child safety online. “These are the tobacco trials of our generation, and for the first time, families across the country will hear directly from big tech CEOs about how they intentionally designed their products to addict our kids.” KGM’s lawsuit alleges that the social media giants intentionally designed their platforms to be addictive, despite knowing the risks to young people. KGM, a California teen, started using social media at age 10, despite her mom’s attempts to use third party software to block access to the platforms, according to court documents. “Defendants design their products in a manner that enables children to evade parental consent,” the complaint states. The “addictive design” of Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat and frequent notifications led her to use the platforms compulsively, the suit alleges, which corresponded with a decline in her mental health. Features that recommend other users to connect with on Snapchat and Instagram “facilitated and created connections between minor Plaintiff K.G.M. and complete strangers, including predatory adults and others she did not know in real life,” the complaint states. Instagram and TikTok also allegedly “targeted” KGM with “depressive” and “harmful social comparison and body image” content. Lawsuit alleges social media giants buried their own research on teen mental health harms On Instagram, KGM alleges she was bullied and sextorted — a scam where a bad actor threatens to share explicit photos of a person if they don’t send money or more photos. It took two weeks and “K.G.M.’s friends and family spamming and asking other Instagram users to report the persons targeting” her for Meta to address the problem, according to the complaint. “Defendants’ knowing and deliberate product design, marketing, distribution, programming and operational decision and conduct caused serious emotional and mental harms to K.G.M. and her family,” the complaint states. “Those harms include, but are not limited to, dangerous dependency on their products, anxiety, depression, self-harm, and body dysmorphia.” KGM’s is one of several bellwether cases in a larger multi-district litigation consolidating around 1,500 personal injury cases alleging similar harms because of TikTok, YouTube, Meta and Snap. In 2024, then-US Surgeon General Vivek Murthycalled on Congressto mandate a tobacco-style warning label on social media platforms in light of the “mental health crisis” among young people, somethingstate attorneys generalhave also advocated for. And a Pew Research Centerstudypublished last year indicated that nearly half of US teens believe social media has “mostly negative” effects on people their age. But tech leaders have for years rejected the idea that social media harms young people’s mental health. They point to alack of conclusive researchon the subject and argue that their platforms provide benefits such as entertainment and connection to friends. Tech giants have also repeatedly relied on Section 230, a federal law that shields them from liability over content that their users post, as a defense against safety claims. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl, who is overseeing the KGM and related cases,said last yearthat jurors should consider whether design features implemented by the companies, like endlessly scrolling feeds, have contributed to mental health harms rather than content alone. Snap haspreviously saidthat Snapchat was “designed differently from traditional social media — it opens to the camera, not a feed, and has no public likes or social comparison metrics.” YouTube will let parents stop their teens from endlessly scrolling short videos Snapchat’s youth safety measures include parental control tools,message warningsdesgined to prevent sextortion and mechanisms for removing age-inappropriate content. Asked for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed CNN to a website dedicated to its response to the youth mental health lawsuits, where the company claims the suits “misportray our company and the work we do every day to provide young people with safe, valuable experiences online.” “We have listened to parents, researched the issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens online,” Meta states. “Despite the snippets of conversations or cherry-picked quotes that plaintiffs’ counsel may use to paint an intentionally misleading picture of the company, we’re proud of the progress we’ve made, we stand by our record of putting teen safety first, and we’ll keep making improvements.” Meta’s teen safety features include“teen accounts,”which launched in 2024 to provide default privacy protections and content limits for teen users on Instagram. It also provides parentalsupervisiontools and uses AI to try to identify minor users regardless of the age they provide when they sign up for Meta’s platforms. In a statement to CNN, YouTube spokesperson José Castañeda said the allegations in the youth mental health lawsuits are “simply not true.” “Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work. In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls,” he said in the statement. YouTube’s youth safety measures include restrictions on certain kinds of sensitive content, such as violent or sexually suggestive videos, as well as AI identification of minor users. It also offers parental control tools andlast week rolled outan option for parents to limit or block their kids from scrolling through its short-form video feed, among other new offerings. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Theyouth safety and parental control featuresTikTok has rolled out in recent years include adding default privacy settings and disabling late-night notifications. Last year, it introduced a“guided meditation”feature purportedly aimed at getting teens to cut back on scrolling. Despite those efforts, many parents and advocates say social media platforms have still failed to protect young users. Soon, a jury will have a chance to decide if they agree.",2026-01-26T10:00:48.168Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/social-media-youth-mental-health-trial,Clare Duffy,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2216108329.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:45
TikTok users say they can’t upload anti-ICE videos. The company blames tech issues,"The comedian Megan Stalter, who posts absurd character skits to an audience in the high hundreds of thousands across Instagram and TikTok, tried sharing a different kind of video on Saturday night. Driven by thedeath of Alex Pretti, the nurse shot by a federal immigration agent or agents that day, she had recorded herself urging her fellow Christians to speak out against ICE raids in Minneapolis. “We have to abolish ICE,” Stalter said in thevideo. “I truly, truly believe that is exactly what Jesus would do.” On Instagram, the video was reposted more than 12,000 times. But her plea never made it to TikTok. In a follow-up post on Instagram, shesaidshe had attempted to upload the video to TikTok several times with no success, then had given up and deleted her TikTok account entirely, believing her content was being censored because it was about ICE. (CNN has reached out to Stalter for comment.) Other users reported the same combination of events, drawing a circumstantial connection between their efforts to make videos about ICE and the difficulties they had posting them over the weekend. The controversy caught the attention of Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, whosaidthat among “threats to democracy,” the purported censorship on TikTok was “at the top of the list.” (CNN has reached out to Murphy’s office for comment.) TikTok said in a statement that glitches on the app were due to a power outage at a US data center. As a result, a spokesperson forTikTok US Joint Venturetold CNN, it’s taking longer for videos to be uploaded and recommended to other users. The tech issues were “unrelated to last week’s news,” TikTok said. On Tuesday morning, TikTok US Joint Venturesaidit had made “significant progress” in restoring service to US users but noted that users may still have trouble uploading new videos. Last week, a majority American-owned joint venture took control of TikTok’s assets in the US, in a deal shepherded by the Trump administration under a 2024 law requiring the app to move out from under its previous Chinese ownership or face a ban in the United States. Among its new investors is the tech company Oracle, whose executive chair Larry Ellison is a close affiliate of President Donald Trump. Oracle will store US TikTok users’ data in a “secure US cloud environment,” according toTikTok, and the new joint venture will “have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.” As a private platform, TikTok is free to exert influence on what users can upload or see. Even if accusations of TikTok’s censorship are unprovable, it’s understandable that US users would be increasingly skeptical of the platform in this moment, said Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “There’s not a lot of trust in the leadership of social media platforms in general,” Fiesler told CNN. “And given the connection of the new ownership of TikTok to the Trump administration, which is so wrapped up in what is happening with ICE in Minnesota, it’s not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust.” Fiesler said she was “unsurprised” about censorship concerns on TikTok, given the timing. Almost immediately after oversight of TikTok’s US operations changed, misinformation started to spread about changes to the app’s new terms of service, including those that applied to location sharing and data collection, Fiesler said. “A lot of TikTok users are concerned about what this new ownership means, both with respect to who has access to their data, and how content recommendation might change or could change,” Fiesler said. “I think those are valid concerns.” A few days ago, Fieslerpostedsome videos aiming to debunk those rumors about the changes to the terms of service, and those were uploaded without issue. She has attempted to upload two videos since Sunday afternoon, one of which she says is still “under review” by TikTok and can’t be viewed publicly. While both generally alluded to ongoing ICE action in Minneapolis, she used it as a framing device to discuss media literacy. One of the videos did successfullyuploadon Monday, though its captions and view counter weren’t working for several hours, she said. “Even if this isn’t purposeful censorship, does it matter? In terms of perception and trust, maybe,” Fiesler said. Jen Hamilton, a nurse and author with more than 4.5 millionTikTok followers, says she became suspicious of TikTok on January 22, the day of the announced change in control in the US, when a video she made about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos being taken by federal agents wouldn’t upload. “It was very ironic for that very first day of this takeover, for me to post something about ICE and then it not be viewable to the public,” Hamilton told CNN, adding that the video still can’t be seen by her followers. After she posted a still about Pretti, her next four videos couldn’t be uploaded, she said. “Something has shifted in the way that content is getting put on the platform, or allowed to be on the platform,” she said, while noting that she didn’t have proof of being personally censored. “And I just find it very ironic that it’s the same day that it takes over that people are not being able to post their stuff.” It would be incredibly difficult to prove TikTok is censoring content about ICE because the platform’s content recommendation process is so opaque, said Jeffrey Blevins, a professor at the University of Cincinnati who studies media law and ethics, among other subjects. Plus, if TikTokwereintentionally censoring content about ICE, it would be within its legal right. “They’re a private platform. They have a First Amendment right to do that,” he said. “A lot of times it’s easy for us to think of social media as a public square, but it’s not public in a way that matters under the law.” Some users, like Stalter, are deleting their accounts and leaving the app altogether (though some have also had trouble deleting their accounts, Fiesler noted). The daily average of TikTok uninstalls are up nearly 150% in the last five days compared to the last three months, market firm SensorTowertoldCNBC on Monday. “If people leave TikTok now, I suspect it’s a combination of things, not just because some videos weren’t posted on one day. It’s also concerns about what this means for the future.” Hamilton said while she’s exploring options like Substack and Patreon, where followers can pay to hear her unvarnished thoughts, she won’t fully abandon TikTok. “This whole thing is intended to dissuade people, especially who are sharing a narrative that is not similar to what the government is wanting people to hear,” she said she suspects. “I think the purpose of having those people feel like their content is not safe on this platform is to get them to stop speaking out, or use the platform differently, or play by the rules.” She’s already figured out ways to continue to talk about ICE, she said. In a video thatdidmake it through TikTok’s uploading process, she calls herself a “fashion influencer” and speaks in code about her trouble uploading an earlier video about Liam. “Fashion influencing is in my blood,” she said in the video, with a photo of Liam behind her. “And even a company with bad customer service won’t keep me from doing my fashion review.”",2026-01-27T02:55:18.241Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/tiktok-ice-censorship-glitch-cec,Scottie Andrew,tech,ctt,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258022749-20260127015621591.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:52
Europe opens major probe into Elon Musk’s X after outcry over sexualized images,"The European Union has launched a wide-reaching investigation into Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot on X following global outrage over its ability to generate sexually explicit images, including of children. The scandal erupted at the end of last year when the AI chatbot churned out a barrage of digitally undressed images of women and children in response to requests from users. The global outcry that followed was met by an initial announcement by X that the tool would be limited to paying subscribers, but the company eventuallyprevented all usersfrom using Grok to create images of real people in revealing clothing. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in astatementMonday that the investigation would examine whether X “properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok’s functionalities into X in the EU.” Henna Virkkunen, a senior commission official focusing on technology, as well security and democracy, said in the statement:“Sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations… or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.” When contacted for comment, X referred CNN to a January 14statementon its social media platform that said among other things: “We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking Child Sexual Exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.” After days of outrage, X restricts Grok’s ability to create explicit images In a briefing for journalists, another European Commission official acknowledged the measures taken by X so far but said the company had not properly assessed the risksbefore launchingthe chatbot. The probe was openedunder the EU’s Digital Services Act, which requires Big Tech companies to do more to tackle illegal and harmful online content. There is no timeline for completing the probenor any indication of what action the European Commision might take based onits findings. However, the official, who asked to remain anonymous, told journalists the body had “quite a few tools at our disposal” and that a fine was possible. “What we are after is changing the platform’s behavior,” they said. The EU hitthe social media platform with a fine of around $140 million in December, saying the “deceptive design” of its blue verification checkmark and other featuresviolated the Digital Services Act. At the time, Musk called the fine “crazy.” When asked whether the fine had been paid, the unnamed EU official said it had not but that the company still had time to settle it.

The deal to secure TikTok’s future in the US has finally closed,"The joint venture acquiring TikTok’s US assets has been formally established and has announced its leadership team,according to the company,one day before the deadline set by President Donald Trump for the app’s US assets to be spun off by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The transaction’s close concludes a yearslong effort to secure TikTok’s long-term future in the United States and address concerns that it posed a national security risk. “The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,” the group said in a statement Thursday. The joint venture will be led by CEO Adam Presser, who previously led TikTok’s efforts to secure Americans’ user data in the United States, and Chief Security Officer Will Farrell, who led privacy and security for the effort. It will be overseen by a board that includes TikTok US CEO Shou Chew; Kenneth Glueck, Executive Vice President in the Office of the Chief Executive Officer at Oracle; and representatives of investment firm Susquehanna International Group and private equity firm Silver Lake, Emirati investment firm MGX, among others. Trump thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for “working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal.” “He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision,” Trump said in hisTruth Social post. The Chinese government has not directly addressed the final deal structure. CNN has reached out to China’s Ministry of Commerce for comment. Trump also said he was “so happy to have helped in saving TikTok,” and expressed appreciation to those in his administration who brought the deal to a “very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.” The US TikTok saga began when Trump, during his first term, vowed to ban the app. It ramped up in 2024 when then-President Joe Biden signed a law requiring that the US version of the app be spun off from its parent company, ByteDance, or be banned in the United States. During his second term, Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law as he sought a deal to transfer control of the app’s US operations to American ownership. When he approved the deal last fall, Trump gave the parties a January 23 deadline to finalize the transaction. TikToksignedthe deal last month. The deal will likely be good news to TikTok’s more than 200 million American users, many of whom rely on the app for entertainment, news and, in some cases, even their livelihoods. The agreement transferred control of TikTok’s US user data and most of its US operations to a new joint venture, 50% of which will be owned by a consortium of investors comprised of tech company Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Emirati-backed investment firm MGX. Just over 30% of the joint venture will be held by “affiliates of certain existing investors in ByteDance,” and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to amemoChew sent to employees last month. The new entity plans to retrain TikTok’s algorithm on US user data, and Oracle will oversee storage of Americans’ data. The US joint venture will also be responsible for content moderation for US users. However, the ByteDance-controlled global TikTok entity will continue to manage e-commerce, advertising and marketing on the new US platform, according to Chew’s memo. That means American users’ experience on the app is unlikely to change in a visible way, although the algorithm that determines what videos are served to their feeds could shift as the new ownership group takes control. Trump last yeardesignated the spinoff dealas a “qualified divestiture” under the sale-or-ban law. But questions remain about whether the arrangement fully addresses the core national security concerns that motivated US lawmakers to pass the law on a bipartisan basis in the first place. US officials had worried that ByteDance could be forced to manipulate the algorithm on behalf of the Chinese government to influence or generate dissent among Americans. The TikTok ban-or-sale law prohibited “any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm” between ByteDance and a new potential American ownership group. “Interoperability enables the Joint Venture to provide U.S. users with a global TikTok experience, ensuring U.S. creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale,” the joint venture group said in its statement. Democratic Senator Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, said Friday that the final deal “raises many more questions than answers.” “Despite my repeated requests for information, the White House has provided virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence,” Markey said in a statement. “This lack of transparency reeks. Congress has a responsibility to investigate this deal, demand transparency, and ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.” Under the deal finalized Thursday, the new joint venture will continue to license the TikTok algorithm from ByteDance before retraining and reviewing it. Whether Beijing would approve the deal had also remained uncertain up until the deal’s close. TikTok had become a leverage point in broader US-China trade negotiations; an earlier version of the deal wasderailedlast year after Trump announced a new round of tariffs. Last month, He Yongqian, a spokesperson for the ministry,reiteratedthat Beijing and Washington had reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues about TikTok and trade. “The Chinese government hopes that enterprises will arrive at solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and reflect a balance of interests,” He said at a presser. “China hopes that the US side will work in the same direction as China, earnestly fulfill its relevant commitments, provide a fair, open, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment for the continued stable operation of Chinese enterprises in the US.” CNN’s John Liu in Hong Kong and Joyce Jiang in Beijing contributed reporting.",2026-01-23T00:32:02.961Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/22/tech/tiktok-us-deal-closes,Clare Duffy,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/16-tiktokapp-bej-20260122212850523.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:34:08
Like digging ‘your own professional grave’: The translators grappling with losing work to AI,"As a rare Irish-language translator, Timothy McKeon enjoyed steady work for European Union institutions for years. But the rise of artificial intelligence tools that can translate text and, increasingly, speech nearly instantly has upended his livelihood and that of many others in his field. He says he lost about 70% of his income when the EU translation work dried up. Now, available work consists of polishing machine-generated translations, jobs he refuses “on principle” because they help train the software taking work away from human translators. When the edited text is fed back into the translation software, “it learns from your work.” “The more it learns, the more obsolete you become,” he said. “You’re essentially expected to dig your own professional grave.” While workers worldwide ponder how AI might affect their livelihoods – a topic on theagendaatthe World Economic Forum in Davos this week – that question is no longer hypothetical in the translation industry. Apps like Google Translate already reduced the need for human translators, and increased adoption of generative AI has only accelerated that trend. A 2024surveyof writing professionals by the United Kingdom’s Society of Authors showed that more than a third of translators had lost work due to generative AI, which can create sophisticated text, as well as images and audio, from users’ prompts.And43% of translators said their income had dropped because of the technology. In the United States, data from 2010-23 analyzed byCarl Frey and Pedro Llanos-Paredes at Oxford Universityshowedthat regions where Google Translate was in greater use saw slower growth in the number of translator jobs. Originally powered by statistical translation, Google Translate shifted to a technique called neural translation in 2016, resulting in more natural-sounding text and bringing it closer to today’s AI tools. “Our best baseline estimate is that roughly 28,000 more jobs for translators would’ve been added in the absence of machine translation,” Frey told CNN. “It’s not a story of mass displacement but I think that’s very likely to follow.” The story is similar globally, suggests McKeon: He is part of theGuerrilla Media Collective, an international group of translators and communications professionals, and says everyone in the collective supplements their income with other work due to the impact of AI. Christina Green is president of Green Linguistics, a provider of language services, and a court interpreter in Wisconsin. She worries her court role could soon vanish because of abillthat would allow courts to use AI or other machine translation in civil or criminal proceedings, and in certain other cases. Green and other language professionals have been fighting the proposal since it was introduced in May. “The entire US is looking at Wisconsin” as a precedent, Green said, noting that the bill’s opponents had so far succeeded in stalling it. While Green still has her court job, her companyrecently lost a majorFortune 10corporate client, whichshe said opted to use a company offering AI translationinstead. The client accounted for such an outsized share of her company’s business that she had to make layoffs. “People and companies think they’re saving money with AI, but they have absolutely no clue what it is, how privacy is affected and what the ramifications are,” Green said. Fardous Bahbouh, based in London, is an Arabic-language translator and interpreter for international media organizations, including CNN. She has seena considerable reduction in written work in recent years, which she attributes to technological developments and the financial pressures facing media outlets. Bahbouh is also studying for a PhD focusing on the translation industry. Her research shows that technology, including AI, is “hugely impacting” translators and interpreters. “I worry a great deal that governments are not doing enough to help them transition into other work, which could lead to greater inequality, in-work poverty and child poverty,”she told CNN. Many translators are indeed looking to retrain “because translation isn’t generating the income it previously did,” according to Ian Giles, a translator and chair of the Translators Association at theUK’s Society of Authors. The picture is similar in the United States: Many translators are leaving the profession, Andy Benzo, president of the American Translators Association, told CNN. And Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said in Davos Thursday that the number of translators and interpreters at the fund had gone down to 50 from 200 due to greater use of technology. Governments should also do more for those remaining in the translation industry, by introducing stronger labor protections, Bahbouh argued. Despite advances in machine translation and interpretation, technology can’t replace human language workers entirelyjust yet. While using AI tools for everyday tasks like finding directions is “low-risk,” human translators will likely need to be involved for the foreseeable future in diplomatic, legal, financial and medical contexts where the risks are “humongous,” according to Benzo. “I’m a translator and a lawyer and in both professions the nuance of each word is very specific and the (large language models powering AI tools) aren’t there yet, by far,” she said. Meta apologizes after auto-translation mistakenly announces Indian state chief minister’s death Another field relatively untouched by machine translation tools is literary translation. Giles, whotranslates commercial fiction from Scandinavian languages into English, used to supplement his income with translation work from companies, but that has now disappeared. Meanwhile, literary commissions have continued to come in, he said. There’s also one key element of communication that AI can’t replace, according to Oxford University’s Frey: Human connection. “The fact that machine translation is pervasive doesn’t mean you can build a relationship with somebody in France without speaking a word of French,” he said.",2026-01-23T11:00:47.866Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/23/tech/translation-language-jobs-ai-automation-intl,Lianne Kolirin,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2023840777.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:34:16
Elizabeth Holmes asks Trump to let her out of prison early,"Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced Theranos CEO, has asked President Donald Trump for an early release from prison after being convicted of defrauding investors, according to a request filed last year with the Department of Justice. Holmes was convicted in 2022 and reported to a federal prison in Texas in 2023 to serve outher 11-year sentence, which is currently set to end in December 2031. Holmes’ request to commute her sentence, if granted, could see her released nearly six years early. Last year, a US appeals courtupheld the convictionsof Holmes and Theranos President Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. It alsoupheldthe $452 million in restitution that Holmes and Balwani were ordered to pay to victims. Holmes started Theranos,once valued at $9 billion, as a college student and quickly became one of the most well known women in Silicon Valley thanks to her promise to upend the healthcare industry. Theranos claimed its technology could accurately and efficiently test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. It attracted $945 million in financing, a board of well-known political figures and prominent retail partners. But aWall Street Journal investigationcalled into question the company’s testing methods and the capabilities of its technology. In 2018, Holmes and Balwani were each charged with a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both pleaded not guilty. Holmes, 41, is currently serving out her sentence at Federal Prison Camp Bryan, a minimum security federal prison camp approximately 100 miles from Houston. The White House does not comment on clemency requests, and the final decision on any pardons or commutations rests with the president, a White House official told CNN. Attorneys for Holmes could not be immediately reached for comment. In recent months, Holmes has gained renewed attention online after posts again began appearing on her X account, including a recent post lauding Trump’shealth care affordability efforts. The Holmes account, which also features posts about Holmes’ husband, children and activities in prison, notes that posts are “mostly my words, posted by others.” It’s not clear who is managing the account. “We are continuing to fight for my innocence and we know the truth can not be repressed for ever (sic),” Holmes’ accountpostedWednesday evening.

Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary welcomes public feud with Elon Musk,"Michael O’Leary, CEO of Europe’s biggest airline,Ryanair, says his ongoing feud with tech billionaireElon Muskhas boosted the budget carrier’s ticket sales. “It is very good for our bookings,” O’Leary said at a news conference in Dublin on Wednesday, highlighting the fact that the company has been running a “Big Idiot Seat Sale” in recent days. “We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair,” he said, adding that the airline would be offering Musk a free ticket. The squabble began after the Ryanair(RYAAY)bosssaid on January 14 that he wouldn’t install Starlink satellite Wi-Fi technology, which is made by Musk’s firm SpaceX, on the airline’s planes, due to concerns over drag and an associated increase in fuel costs. In aposton X the same day, Musk said O’Leary was “misinformed.” “I doubt they can even measure the difference in fuel use accurately,” he added. Musk also called O’Leary “an utter idiot” and a “retarded twat.” On Friday, O’Leary, who is famously outspoken and known for his skill in harnessing publicity, fired back during aninterviewwith Irish radio station Newstalk. “I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk. He’s an idiot — very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot,” he said. “What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.” Ryanair is suing ‘disruptive passenger’ for $15,000 in damages SpaceX, which Musk founded, is a rocket manufacturer and space transport services company. On Wednesday, O’Leary said he took “no insult” from Musk’s comments. “As anybody with teenage children would know, you’re frequently called an idiot and a twat at home,” he said. “I don’t need to go outside to be insulted.” O’Leary also provided further details behind the decision not to offer Starlink internet connectivity on Ryanair planes, as an increasing number of other airlines have started to do. “It is a very good system,” said O’Leary. “The problem is if you put it on board aircraft, there is a cost.” O’Leary estimates that it would cost Ryanair around $200-250 million a year in installation fees and increased running costs due to fuel drag caused by the two antennae that would have to be installed on the fuselage of each of the company’s 643 planes. Ryanair would not be able to recover these costs by charging passengers to use the service, according to O’Leary. Elon Musk’s Starlink to launch on United Airlines flights by spring Although Starlink claims that around 90% of passengers are willing to pay for internet access, the airline has found that less than 10% would do so, he said. O’Leary also expressed his surprise that the decision had resulted in a feud, which has also seen Musk raise the possibility of buying Ryanair. “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?” hewroteon Friday. “How much would it cost to buy you?” he wrote in anotherreplyto the airline that day. On Wednesday, O’Leary said that while non-European Union citizens cannot own a majority stake in European airlines, he would welcome Musk’s investment. “We would think it’s a very good investment, certainly a significantly better investment than the financial returns he is earning on X,” he said. “And we want to thank him sincerely for the additional publicity.”",2026-01-21T14:19:55.741Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/21/tech/ryanair-oleary-musk-spat-scli-intl,Jack Guy,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2026-01-21t100833z-2088126067-rc2l5jalel6o-rtrmadp-3-ryanair-oleary-musk.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:34:32
What is the heliosphere? A new mission could unravel the mysteries of this complex cosmic environment,"Surrounding our solar system is a natural and enigmatic cosmic shield called the heliosphere — and a new mission has launched to help astronomers better understand it. Created by the solar wind, a constant flow of charged particles that stream away from the sun, theheliosphereacts as an enormous bubble that protects the planets in our solar system from cosmic radiation permeating the Milky Way, our home galaxy. In addition to Earth’s protective magnetic field, the heliosphere plays a major role in why life is possible on our planet — and how it perhaps once existed on others such asMars. Over half a dozen missions   have contributed to how astronomers understand the heliosphere, and two enduring spacecraft, the Voyager probes, havecollected key dataafter exiting the heliosphere to explore interstellar space. But the new IMAP, orInterstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, mission is designed to investigate how the sun forms its solar wind, and how that solar wind interacts with interstellar space at the boundary of the heliosphere, which begins at a range three times the distance between Earth and Pluto, according to NASA. The spacecraft’s 10 instruments will also fill gaps in the existing map of the heliosphere, pieced together from data collected by previous missions, and help further explain how the heliosphere largely shields our solar system from damaging cosmic rays, the most highly energetic particles in the universe. Along with two other space weather missions that lifted off aboard the same rocket on Wednesday, IMAP will help scientists better predict when solar storms unleashed by the sun could affect our planet. When aimed at Earth, harsh radiation from the storms, also known as space weather, can pose risks to astronauts on the International Space Station as well as interfere with communications, the electric power grid, navigation, and radio and satellite operations. “This next set of missions is the ultimate cosmic carpool,” said Dr. Joe Westlake, director of NASA’s Heliophysics Division, during a news conference on Sunday. “They will provide unprecedented insight into space weather. Every human on Earth, as well as nearly every system involved in space exploration and human needs, is affected by space weather.” The heliosphere was first theorized by multiple scientists investigating the concept of cosmic rays and the solar wind in the late 1950s, according toNASA. They believed the sun provided a web of magnetic fields and solar wind thatcreated a boundarysurrounding Earth and the rest of the solar system. Mariner 2, the first successful mission to another planet that performed a flyby of Venus in 1962, also was the first to measure the solar wind, proving its existence. Direct measurements taken by thePioneer 10 and 11 missionsin the 1970s, as well as the Voyager probes, provided further proof of the heliosphere. Scientists are eager to know what the boundaries of the heliosphere look like, something that the Voyager probes have offered tantalizing glimpses of in the past. They are the only two spacecraft to cross the heliosphere. Voyager 1 reached the heliosphere boundary in 2012, while the slower Voyager 2 crossed the boundary in 2018, providing snapshots in two specific locations. The information collected by these probes is helping scientists learn about the heliosphere’s cometlike shape. The IBEX, or Interstellar Boundary Explorer, satellite has been mapping the heliosphere since launching in 2008. But IMAP can explore and map the boundaries of the heliosphere like never before because it has instruments with faster imaging that are capable of 30 times higher resolution. Once it reaches an orbit about 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth in about three months, IMAP will also capture observations of the solar wind in real time and measure particles that travel from the sun, study the heliosphere’s boundary between 6 billion and 9 billion miles (9.7 billion to 14.5 billion kilometers) away, and even collect data from interstellar space. Predominately, IMAP will measure energetic neutral atoms, called ENAs, or uncharged particles that form when an energetic charged ion collides with a slow-moving neutral atom. The process that forms these particles, found wherever there is plasma, or charged gas, in space, also occurs throughout the heliosphere and along its boundary. IMAP will rely on tracking these particles to create a more complete map of the heliosphere, according to NASA. The particles travel in a straight line, unaffected by magnetic fields because they are not charged, so IMAP can collect ENAs near Earth and trace them to their origins, like the otherwise invisible boundaries of the heliosphere, according to NASA. “IMAP is going to make incredibly detailed pictures that will evolve over time of that interaction region,” said Dr. David McComas, IMAP’s principal investigator and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. “It will be able to understand what the shielding is, how the shielding works and what it looks like.” McComas added that our solar system is not alone in having something like a heliosphere, and brightastrosphereshave been spotted around other stars. IMAP launched alongside NASA’s Carruthers Geocorona Observatory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s SWFO-L1, or Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. ET. NASA streamed the launch live onYouTube. TheCarruthers Geocorona Observatoryis a small satellite that will be dedicated to observing the exosphere, or Earth’s outermost atmospheric layer. The Carruthers mission will capture images of the region’s faint ultraviolet glow, called the geocorona, to help answer questions about the exosphere’s shape, size and density. The mission is named for Dr. George Carruthers, who developed an ultraviolet camera as the first moon-based observatory that was placed during the Apollo 16 mission. The camera, still in place in the Descartes highland region on the moon, photographed Earth in ultraviolet light and captured the first image of the exosphere in 1972. The Carruthers mission will measure changes and the effects of space weather once it reaches Earth, given that the exosphere marks a transitional boundary between Earth and space. Meanwhile, theSWFO-L1 missionis intended to act as a solar storm detector, providing early warnings to protect astronauts in low-Earth orbit and satellites that provide critical communications on Earth. It’s a tool that will be even more necessary as astronauts venture farther into deep space. “I think we’re getting better…but a really solid forecast, I think, is still something that we’re striving for,” said Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, at a news conference for the agency’s upcoming Artemis II mission around the moon. “And obviously the missions that we’re putting up now will give us much better insight into not just the one piece of the problem, but the whole problem, from what’s happening on the sun to how that then propagates out from the sun, and whether it becomes a real problem or not.” Two billionaires have very different — and equally wild — visions of a future in space. Is either possible? The satellite’s compact coronagraph telescope will monitor the sun for activity and measure the solar wind, providing a constant stream of data to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Images of solar storms taken by the satellite can be sent to the center within 30 minutes, while other current missions, like NASA and the European Space Agency’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, launched in 1995, can take up to eight hours. “SWFO-L1’s essential data is our lifeline for keeping the lights on, planes flying and satellites safe, ensuring that America is ready for what the sun sends our way ,” said Clinton Wallace, director of NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.

Black hole collision confirms decades-old predictions by Einstein and Hawking,"Astronomers have detected a collision between two black holes in unprecedented detail, offering the clearest view yet into the nature of these cosmic oddities and confirming long-held predictions made by legendary physicists Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. The event, dubbed GW250114, became known in January when researchers spotted it with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) — a set of two identical instruments located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. The instruments detected gravitational waves, faint ripples in space-time produced by the two black holes slamming into each other. Searching for gravitational waves, phenomena predicted in 1915 as part of Einstein’s theory of relativity, is the only way to identify black hole collisions from Earth. Einstein believed that the waves would be too weak to ever be picked up by human technology, butin September 2015, LIGOrecorded themfor the very first time, later netting a Nobel Prize for three scientists who made key contributions to the development of this “black hole telescope.” The newly detected black holes were each around 30 to 35 times the mass of the sun, and they were spinning very slowly, said Maximiliano Isi, an assistant professor of astronomy at Columbia University and an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City. Isi led a newstudyfor the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration on the GW250114 data, which published Wednesday in the journal Physical Review Letters. Martian rock contains ‘clearest sign’ yet of ancient life on Mars, NASA says “The black holes were about 1 billion light years away, and they were orbiting around each other in almost a perfect circle,” Isi said. “The resulting black hole was around 63 times the mass of the sun, and it was spinning at 100 revolutions per second.” These characteristics make the merger an almost exact replica of that first, groundbreaking detection from 10 years ago, according to Isi. “But now, because the instruments have improved so much since then, we can see these two black holes with much greater clarity, as they approached each other and merged into a single one,” he added. Isi said the observation gives scientists a totally new view into “the dynamics of space and time.” LIGO, which also has two smaller sister instruments — Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan — is managed by a global scientificcommunityof about 1,600 researchers. It works by detecting tiny stretches in space caused by the gravitational waves that amount to “a change in distance that is 1,000 times smaller than the radius of the nucleus of an atom,” as Isi puts it. Scientists have used it to observe over 300 black hole mergers so far. Earlier this year, the instrument detected themost massive black hole collisionto date between two black holes approximately 100 and 140 times the mass of the sun. Since it debuted, some of LIGO’s key components — including its lasers and mirrors — have been upgraded to increase accuracy and reduce background noise. This improved performance made its new observation over three times more precise than the inaugural one a decade ago. That unprecedented clarity allowed astronomers to use GW250114 to confirm predictions about black holes made decades ago by prominent physicists. The first prediction, devised by New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr in 1963, builds upon Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and states that black holes should be paradoxically simple objects, described by a single equation. “Yes, black holes are very mysterious, complex and have important implications to the evolution of the universe,” Isi said, “but mathematically we think they should be fully described by just two numbers. Everything there is to know about them should come from how big the black hole is — or what its mass is — and how fast it’s rotating.” Brightest fast radio burst ever detected could help solve an enduring cosmic mystery To test this theory, the researchers used a unique feature of black hole collisions: a “ringing” or vibration — like a bell that’s been struck — that the final black hole produces. “If you have a bell and you strike it with a hammer, it will ring,” Isi noted. “The pitch and duration of the sound, the characteristics of the sound, tell you something about what the bell is made of. With black holes something similar happens — they ring in gravitational waves.” This ringing includes information about the structure of the black hole and the space around it, Isi added. Although the phenomenon was faintly observed before, GW250114 returned a signal with “two modes … a fundamental mode and an overtone” with much more clarity. “We identified two components of this ringing, and that allowed us to test that this black hole really is consistent with being described by just two numbers, mass and rotation,” he said. “And this is fundamental to our understanding of how space and time works — that these black holes should be featureless, in some way. It’s the first time we are able to see this so compellingly.” The second prediction confirmed by GW250114 is one made in 1971 by British physicist Stephen Hawking, which states that when two black holes merge, the resulting surface area must be equal to or greater than that of the original black holes. “It’s a profound, but very simple theorem that says the total surface area of a black hole can never decrease — it can only get bigger or stay the same,” Isi said. Although previous LIGO observations offered tentativeconfirmationsof the theorem, the clarity of this new signal gives researchers unparalleled confidence, Isi said. “Because we’re able to identify the portion of the signal that comes from the black holes early on, as they are separated from each other, we can infer their areas from that,” he explained. “Then we can look at the very final portion of the signal that comes from the final black hole, and measure its own area.” Just like Kerr’s equation, Hawking’s theorem also uses Einstein’s work as its foundation: “Einstein’s theories are like the operating system for all of this,” Isi explained. Kip Thorne, one of the three recipients of the Nobel Prize for LIGO contributions, said Hawking called him as soon as he learned of the 2015 gravitational wave detection to ask if LIGO would be able to test his theorem. “If Hawking were alive, he would have reveled in seeing the area of the merged black holes increase,” Thorne said of the esteemed physicist, who died in 2018, in a statement about the new findings. It’s remarkable how this seminal, theoretical work is being confirmed decades later with advanced instruments, Isi said. And confirming Hawking’s equation, he added, could have implications for a very sought-after goal in physics — combining the seemingly incompatible theory of general relativity, which describes gravity, with quantum mechanics, which relates to the subatomic world. “LIGO has created an entire new branch of astronomy. It has revolutionized what we think about compact objects, black holes in particular,” he said. “Before LIGO turned on, people weren’t even sure that black holes could merge and crash and form in this way.” Gravitational waves are very weak, and the titanic task of detecting them is often described as looking for a needle in a haystack, according to Emanuele Berti, a professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the study. He described the LIGO detectors as “hearing aids” that help with this process. “A large group of scientists spent the last ten years improving those hearing aids, and now we can ‘hear’ the signals with much higher clarity,” he said in an email. “We can now test fundamental principles of gravity that we could not test ten years ago.” Among these principles, he added, is the idea that black holes are the simplest macroscopic objects in the universe. The level of detail in the “ringing” produced by the GW250114 collision means scientists can say with confidence that the final object is consistent with the black holes predicted by Einstein’s general relativity, which Berti says is “terribly exciting.” Leor Barack, a professor of mathematical physics at the University of Southampton in England who was also not part of the study, noted that among the more than 300 black-hole merger events recorded by LIGO, the latest one stands out as “particularly spectacular,” and calls the new study a long-awaited analysis. Scientists were able to extract two of the “pure tones” of the remnant black hole as it settled into its final form, Barack added. “This included, for the first time, a clear extraction of the first ‘overtone,’ a fainter harmonious sound of the ringing hole, in addition to the primary tone,” he said. “This kind of test is the most precise to date, by a long margin.” New type of supernova ‘looks like nothing anyone has ever seen before,’ astronomer says The study represents a significant milestone in gravitational wave astronomy, said Macarena Lagos, an assistant professor at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile. Lagos also was not involved with the work. She agreed that the detection of a second tone in the “ringing” black hole is particularly significant, adding that GW250114 demonstrates the success of LIGO’s ongoing improvements and shows that gravitational wave detections can test fundamental physics in ways never before possible. “While current tests of gravity still have broad uncertainties, this work lays the groundwork for future detections” of even better quality expected in the coming years, Lagos said in an email. “These future observations promise to provide more precise tests of our understanding of spacetime and gravity.” Sign up forCNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

"Rock discovery contains ‘clearest sign’ yet of ancient life on Mars, NASA says","Scientists believe intriguing leopard spots on a rock sampled by the Perseverance rover on Mars last year may have potentially been made by ancient life, NASA announced Wednesday. The team has also published a peer-reviewed paper in the journalNatureabout the new analysis, though they say further study is needed. “After a year of review, theyhave come back and they said, listen, we can’t find another explanation,” said Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. “So this very well could be the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars, which is incredibly exciting.” The sample, called Sapphire Canyon, was collected by the Perseverance rover from rocky outcrops on the edges of the Neretva Vallis river valley, a region sculpted by water that once flowed into Jezero Crater more than 3 billion years ago. The rover landed within the crater to explore the ancient lake site in February 2021, seeking rocks created or modified by water on Mars in the past. Perseverance drilled the Sapphire Canyon sample from an arrowhead-shaped rock called Cheyava Falls in July 2024. Although the sample is safely ensconced in a tube millions of miles away on Mars, scientists have remained intrigued by the rock because of its potential to reveal whether microscopic life ever existed on the red planet. “The discovery of a potential biosignature, or a feature or signature that could be consistent with biological processes, but that requires further work and study to confirm a biological origin is something that we’re sharing with you all today that grows from years of hard work, dedication and collaboration between over 1,000 scientists and engineers here at the (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory and our partner institutions around the country and internationally,” said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance project scientist at JPL, during a news conference Wednesday. Shortly after the rock was found, members of the Perseverance science team said it was exactly the type of rock they were hoping to find. NASA initially shared the Cheyava Falls rock discovery at the end of July 2024. The new announcement Wednesday is the result of a long, peer-reviewed research process and the collection of more data, said lead study author Joel Hurowitz, a planetary scientist at Stony Brook University in New York. Peer review and publication are crucial steps in the scientific process that allow NASAto make the mission data and the science team’s interpretation of that data available to the broader science community for further study, said Lindsay Hays, senior scientist for Mars Exploration at NASA’s Planetary Science Division. “Hopefully, eventually this will be followed by the delivery of these samples back to Earth where they could be studied in terrestrial labs,” Hays added. Perseverance rover surveyed the river valley after finding the sample to better understand the environment where the rocks were deposited and determine how the leopard spots may have formed, Hurowitz said. Understanding exactly how those spots came to be — whether through geochemical processes that don’t require life or due to the presence of microbial life — is a crucial step in determining whether the rock contains evidence of a potential biosignature. “Today, we are really showing you how we are kind of one step closer to answering humanity’s, one of their most profound questions, and that is, are we truly alone in the universe?” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. More than 3.5 billion years ago, the Neretva Vallis would have been filled with rushing rivers carrying mud, sand and gravel into the lake, Stack Morgan said. “Inside the crater, this kind of energetic setting was probably punctuated by periods of calm when water would have backed up, creating a relatively low energy lake environment,” she added. When the water eventually dried up, it left behind the rocky outcrop where Cheyava Valls was found, called Bright Angel, preserving a record of a “potential habitable environment” on Mars, Stack Morgan said. “These really ancient rocks provide us the window into a period of time that’s not particularly well represented on our own planet Earth, but it’s a time when life was emergent on Earth, and could have been on Mars as well,” she added. Cheyava Falls, named for one of the Grand Canyon’s waterfalls, showcased small black spots nicknamed “poppy seeds” by Perseverance’s science team, as well as larger markings dubbed leopard spots. “These textural features told us that something really interesting had happened in these rocks, some chemical reactions occurred at the time they were being deposited,” Hurowitz said. The rover’s SHERLOC instrument, or Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals, also detected organic compounds in the rock. The SHERLOC results were a “smoking gun indicator for the presence of organic matter in this mud,” Hurowitz said. Organic compounds were also found in a couple of other locations in the Bright Angel formation. “This tells us that we had a rusty red mud that was deposited in the presence of organic matter,” Hurowitz said. On Earth, these carbon-based molecules are the building blocks of life. The mottling on the rock could indicate that ancient chemical reactions occurring within it once supported microbial organisms. White veins of calcium sulfate present clear evidence that water — crucial for life — once ran through the rock. And the irregular-shaped leopard spots, tested by the rover’s PIXL instrument, short for Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, detected iron and phosphate within the features. The team also spotted the potential presence of hematite between the white bands of calcium sulfate in the rock. Hematite is one of the minerals responsible for Mars’ signature red hue. The leopard spotting may have occurred when chemical reactions with hematite turned the rock from red to white, which can release iron and phosphate and potentially cause the black rings to form. Such reactions can also provide an energy source for microbes. The features are likely due to the presence of ferrous iron phosphate and iron sulfide, or the minerals vivianite and greigite,according to the researchers.Typically, these minerals form in environments with a low temperature and the presence of water. “On Earth, things like these sometimes form in sediments where microbes are eating organic matter and ‘breathing’ rust and sulfate,” said study coauthor Dr. Michael Tice, a geobiologist and astrobiologist in the department of geology and geophysics at Texas A&M University, in a statement. “Their presence on Mars raises the question: could similar processes have occurred there?” In the study, the authors explore two potential scenarios for how the rock features formed: due to the presence of life or without it. While it’s possible that some of the features could be produced strictly geochemically due to reactions between organic matter and iron, that process usually only works at relatively high temperatures — something the team does not see evidence of, Tice said. “All the ways we have of examining these rocks on the rover suggest that they were never heated in a way that could produce the leopard spots and poppy seeds,” Tice explained. “If that’s the case, we have to seriously consider the possibility that they were made by creatures like bacteria living in the mud in a Martian lake more than three billion years ago.” Cheyava Falls may have begun as a mixture of deposited mud and organic compounds that eventually cemented to become rock, according to the research. Later on, water may have penetrated through cracks in the rock, depositing minerals to create the calcium sulfate veins and leopard spots. “What’s exciting about these finds, this sort of combination of mud and organic matter that has reacted to produce these minerals and these textures, is that when we see features like this are often the byproduct of microbial metabolisms that are consuming organic matter and making these minerals as a result of those reactions,” Hurowitz said. Hurowitz also acknowledged that there are nonbiological ways to create features like the leopard spots. “What we need to do from here is to continue to do additional research in laboratory settings here on Earth,and ultimately bring the sample from this rock backhome to Earth, so that we can make the final determination for what process actually gave rise to these fantastic textures,” he said. Scientists are still in the process of analyzing the geologic context of the sample, but the new paper represents an overview of how they currently understand the Cheyava Falls rock, Stack Morgan said. More papers are expected over the next year or so. “While we were exploring the Bright Angel area, we basically threw the entire rover science payload at this rock, and so we’re pretty close to the limits of what the rover can do on the surface in terms of making progress on that particular question,” Stack Morgan said. Since landing on Mars, Perseverance has crossed Jezero Crater and explored an ancient river delta in search of microfossils of past life. The rover has been collecting samples along the way that were intended to be returned to Earth by future missions. But it’s currently unclear how NASA would return the samples to Earth as the agency grapples with the White House’s proposal toslash NASA’s science budgetby as much as half. “We’re looking at how we get the sample back, or other samples back,” Duffy said. “What we’re going to do is look at our budgets, we look at our timing, and you know, how do we spend money better, and you know, what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly? And so that’s a current analysis that’s happening right now.” To ultimately answer the question of whether life has ever existed on the red planet, returning the samples is necessary, scientists say. “Bringing this sample back to Earth would allow us t",2025-09-10T15:54:18.134Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/10/science/nasa-mars-sapphire-falls-rock-sample,Ashley Strickland,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1-pia26368-perseverance-finds-a-rock-with-leopard-spots.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:34:58
Rare ‘tooth-in-eye’ surgery restores man’s vision after two decades,"When Brent Chapman was 13, he took ibuprofen during a Christmas basketball game. It was a drug he had taken before, but what happened next was anything but routine: He had a severe reaction that caused burns all over his body, including on the surface of his eyes. Chapman was in a coma for 27 days. He lost his left eye to an infection and lost most of his vision in the other. His body recovered, but his vision fully never returned. “For the last 20 years, I’ve been having close to 50 surgeries trying to save this eye, most of them cornea transplants,” Chapman said of his right eye. “We would put a new cornea in. It would last sometimes just a few months or even up to years, but it would just kind of never heal.” But Dr. Greg Moloney, clinical associate professor of corneal surgery at the University of British Columbia, was able to restore Chapman’s sight this year with a rare procedure that involved implanting Chapman’s own tooth into his eye. “I’m very happy and am just taking in the world again, appreciating the little things. It’s been kind of surreal and kind of a euphoric feeling to it,” Chapman said. The procedure, also known as tooth-in-eye or osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, involves removing a patient’s tooth, sewing a piece of it into the cheek and placing the structure into their eye. “It’s a situation where a standard corneal transplant simply won’t work,” said Dr. Vicente Diaz, assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual science at the Yale School of Medicine. Diaz was not involved with Chapman’s case but treats people who haveStevens-Johnson syndrome, the rare and sometimes fatal drug reaction that caused Chapman’s blindness. The condition causes severe inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes, including the eyes. In some cases, Diaz said, the immune system attacks and destroys the limbal stem cells that are essential for keeping the cornea clear. Without these cells, corneal tissue becomes scarred and keratinized, as if the cornea has skin growing over it, blocking light from reaching the retina. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be triggered by any medication or infection, although certain drugs such as seizure medications, gout medications and antibacterial sulfa drugs carry a higher risk. There are also certaingenetic factorsthat could put someone at a higher risk of developing the disorder. Diaz noted that it can occur at any point in a person’s life, even after previous exposure to the same trigger without incident. In a healthy eye, the cornea acts like a windshield, allowing light to pass through to the lens and then to the retina, where it is converted into electrical signals sent to the brain. The cornea’s clarity depends on adequate lubrication and a steady renewal of cells by limbal stem cells. In conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, those systems fail. When the cornea is permanently opaque and the eye rejects a cornea transplant, surgeons sometimes turn to tooth-in-eye surgery. A canine tooth, which is the longest tooth in the human mouth, is extractedfrom the jaw, along with a thin layer of bone around the tooth that provides support and blood, keeping it alive. The tooth is then shaved into a 4 millimeter-thick block and drilled to hold a plastic optical cylinder, explained Dr. Ben Kang, Chapman’s oral maxillofacial surgeon and division head of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery at Vancouver General Hospital. The shaved tooth, with the lens in place, is implanted into the patient’s cheek or eyelid for several months, allowing soft tissue to grow around it. “The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place,” Moloney said. “It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own.” The next step is to make a hole in the front of the patient’s eye to create space for the new complex. Once the tooth-lens complex is integrated with living tissue, it is surgically attached to the front of the eye, replacing the damaged cornea’s function. Tissue from inside the patient’s mouth is used to cover the tooth part of the device, giving the new eye a pink shade. Light can then pass through the clear lens to the retina, enabling vision again, provided that everything behind the cornea — the retina and optic nerve— remains healthy. Moloney said there are two types of candidates for the surgery: people like Chapman, who have tried every other procedure, or those who are so severely affected by their initial disease that doctors know from the outset that other options won’t work. The surgery, which can take over 12 hours across two stages, is rare and performed by only a handful of specialists worldwide. But for people who qualify, success can mean regaining nearly normal vision. “It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world,” Moloney said. “It’s highly emotional for us.” Chapman’s tooth was extracted in February, and the structure was placed into his eye in June. His last surgery, which straightened the lens to correct visual distortion, took place August 5. Chapman was fitted with glasses on August 13 and now has 20/30 vision, meaning he can see details at a distance of 20 feet that a person with perfect vision can see at 30 feet. The first thing he saw after his surgery was the skyline from Moloney’s 16th-floor office. “It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting. When you’re blind or low-vision, you’re not seeing that, and you’re kind of in your head more. There’s a lot more mental chatter, and it can be difficult,” Chapman said. “Dr. Moloney and I made eye contact for the first time, and we both got quite emotional. I haven’t really made eye contact in 20 years.” Before the tooth-in-eye surgery, Chapman was close to giving up hope. “We definitely didn’t have any more options. The transplants were lasting such a short time, and they were becoming more risky to do surgically,” he said. “Emotionally, even when I would get a new one, I knew it wasn’t going to last. This opened a new door for me and a new chapter in my life. This also provides more stability.” Chapman is looking forward to traveling – with Japan being on the top of the list – but he wants to “just see the world and take it all in.” “I have a niece and a nephew that are 4 and 2. They’re just so cute and so much fun,” he said. He is also a massage therapist and is looking forward to working again. “I’ve had a lot of time off work in the last couple of years with surgeries. I can give back and help people in pain and not make everything about me, and I think psychologically, that’s very helpful.” Above all, Chapman said, he is excited to dream again and “to not be limited by the instability of this condition and be able to plan and think ahead.” “Before, I would always be afraid to plan because I’m afraid I’ll need emergency surgery or have an infection. It was so unpredictable, I would make these plans, and it would be heartbreaking when I couldn’t do them,” he said. Having “human connection again visually” is something that people take for granted but is very powerful for people with poor vision. “We’ve been with him since he was a teenage boy. He’s waited till he’s 34 to get that,” Moloney said. “We’ve all waited a long time.”",2025-09-15T11:09:01.145Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/tooth-in-eye-surgery,Asuka Koda,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/tooth-in-eye-surgery-restores-vision-image1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:35:06
