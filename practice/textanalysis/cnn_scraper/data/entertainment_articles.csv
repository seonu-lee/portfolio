What Bad Bunny’s Grammy wins mean for Latinos in the US,"WhenBad Bunny’s album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” won album of the yearat this year’s Grammy Awards, the moment changed history. For the first time, a Spanish-language album took the Recording Academy’s most prestigious prize in an industry that has long treated Latino music as a category, not a centerpiece. For millions of US Latinos, the win from Bad Bunny – who on Sunday willheadline the Super Bowl halftime show– is more than a musical milestone. It is an affirmation of visibility, and proof of belonging. “It’s beyond inspirational,” said Jeffrey Vargas, a Nuyorican from Bushwick, Brooklyn. “It’s validating and ground-shifting in a moment when it feels like we’re all under attack. The album was more than a vibe. It was a spiritual uplift and a balm for the aching soul,” Vargas told CNN. Across social media and Latino communities nationwide, similar sentiments poured in: pride mixed with relief, celebration layered with resilience, after Bad Bunny clinched three Grammys total this weekend, including best global music performance. “As a Puerto Rican woman, I am beyond proud to see our culture, language, and history elevated globally. We are joyous, defenders of humanity, and our music is infectious,” said Lucria Ortiz, a Puerto Rican community leader from New Bedford, Massachusetts. For many Latinos, Bad Bunny’s success has always felt intimate. The Puerto Rico-born superstar never switched languages to break into the mainstream. He never softened his accent. He never diluted his musical and cultural references. “Instead of watering himself down to be more palatable, he added moresofritoto the pot,” said Liz Arreola, a Mexican-American content creator based in Houston, referencing the popular Caribbean/Latino seasoning blend used to build flavor. In hersocial media post, Arreola said she was incredibly proud of Bad Bunny’s win and the dignified way he is representing Puerto Ricans and Latinos on the global stage. “You can earn the world’s respect by being authentic to yourself, your people, your roots, your culture, your music, your island. That album was so authentic and so real, and it was precisely that authenticity that made the rest of the world connect and fall in love with it,” Arreola said in the post. For decades,Latino artists have been toldthat “crossing over” required crossing out parts of themselves: less Spanish, fewer regional sounds, more “universal” themes. But Bad Bunny did the exact opposite. He centered Caribbean rhythms, street slang and political commentary in an unapologetic celebration of Latino and Puerto Rican pride, which carried over into his acceptance speeches on Sunday night. That matters, says longtime political consultant, activist, philanthropist and producer Luis Miranda. “Bad Bunny’s win, and ‘Buena Vista Social Club’s,’ is recognition that Spanish-language music is part of the fabric of this country,” said Miranda, a producer of the hit Broadway musical whose original Spanish-language cast recording won the 2026 Grammy for best musical theater album. “Our music, our language, our people, have been here forever and will continue to thrive, forever,” Miranda said. The artist’s victory also comes at a time when Latino communities are facing intensified political rhetoric, immigration crackdowns, and perceived cultural erasure. Accepting the award for best música urbana album, Bad Bunny began his speech saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out! We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.” He added: “The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.” In that context, his wins feel even more urgent, making it not just about streams, sales, sold-out concerts or even awards, but about dignity and humanity. “We Latinos are being demonized in this moment. We all needed a reminder that centering love right now is exactly what America needs,” said Ortiz. His acceptance speech for best album, delivered almost entirely in Spanish, emphasized immigrants, dreamers, and those forced to leave home in search of opportunity. For many viewers, his words echoed the experiences of immigrants living in the United States. “On a global stage, his voice joined that of millions of immigrants who today live in fear, but also with hope. It wasn’t just an award. it was an act of solidarity with our community,” posted the staff ofNoticias Para Inmigrantes, a media organization serving Latino immigrants in the US.",2026-02-03T00:26:07.321Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/entertainment/bad-bunny-grammy-wins-us-latinos,Maria Santana,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2259521556.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:26:24
Grammy Awards 2026: See which nominees took home golden gramophones,"It was a history-making night at the Grammy Awards. This year’s Super Bowl halftime performer Bad Bunnytook home album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos),” which became the first-ever Spanish-language album to nab the top prize. Amidst an effusive and emotional acceptance speech in Spanish, the Puerto Rican superstar said in English, “I want to dedicate this award to all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country to follow their dreams.” Earlier in the show, Bad Bunny won for best música urbana album, and took a moment on stage to make a political statement, starting with a declaration of “ICE out,” which was met with extended, lengthy applause. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans,” Bad Bunny continued. “I also want to say to the people, I know it’s tough not to hate on these days and I was thinking, sometimes we getcontaminados…. The hate get more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. If we don’t hate them, we love our people. We love our family and that’s the way to do it. Don’t forget that please.” Another pre-show winner included last year’s Super Bowlhalftime show headliner Kendrick Lamar, who took home three Grammys before the show even started, nabbing another in the first hour of the telecast. With it, he broke the record previously held by Jay-Z and became the most awarded rapper in Grammys history. His wins this weekend included one for best rap album, for “GNX,” as well as record of the year alongside SZA for “luther.” Like Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish – winner for song of the year for “Wildflower” – also made unfiltered statements about ICE while accepting a Grammy. Standing on stage alongside her brother and producing partner Finneas O’Connell, Eilish, who has been an outspoken critic of actions made by ICE officials in recent weeks, said “no one is illegal on stolen land.” Eilish’s final statement on stage was bleeped by television censors, but according to video footage posted online by those in attendance, she said, “F**k ICE.” The most striking looks from the Grammys red carpet Going into Sunday’s show, Lamar led withnine nominations, including for album of the year for his “GNX.” Feted filmmaker Steven Spielberg clinched a Grammy before the show as well, joining theelite ranks of EGOTs(winners of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award) when he was awarded a statuette for best music film for the documentary “Music byJohn Williams,” which he coproduced alongside Ron Howard and many others. Performances included the likes of Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter and all eight best new artist nominees – Addison Rae, Alex Warren, KATSEYE, Leon Thomas, Lola Young, Olivia Dean, SOMBR and The Marías.

"This is Cardi B’s Super Bowl, if we’re being honest","True to her inimitable fashion, this year’s Big Game might end up being all aboutCardi B. The “Bodak Yellow” rapper – who just this past weekend performed in Studio 8H as the musical guest for the 1000th episode of “Saturday Night Live” –has many believingthat she could be a featured performer during this year’s Super Bowl halftime show, headlined by thenewly crowned album of the year Grammy-winnerBad Bunny. She won’t have far to travel, since Cardi B will already be at the game. Like Taylor Swift last year, the spicy rapper has a personal interest in the Super Bowl in that her boyfriend, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, will be playing in the celebrated game alongside his team, the New England Patriots. There were high hopes for Super Bowl LIX last year, since Swift was already in attendance to cheer on her now fiancé Travis Kelce and his Kansas City Chiefs, and fans hoped she would take to the halftime show stage with headliner Kendrick Lamar for a rendition of her “Bad Blood” remix – on which Lamar was a collaborator. That didn’t happen, but now that Cardi B is in her WAG (as the wives and girlfriends of athletes are called) era hopes are running high that she might fulfill the double-duty dream of attending to cheer on her man while also taking the stage for one of the biggest performance events in the world. Goodness knows, Cardi has given the people reason to hope for such things. Her enthusiasm for both football and Diggs, with whom sheshares a newborn son, has been much on display recently. The Grammy winner has shown up at games dressed as if it were Fashion Week, rocking looks from a vintage pink Chanel tweed set to an all-gray leather look by Jagne which included a corset. The woman born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar has made quite the statement, and the NFL has taken notice. Her flowing mint green wig provided a conspicuous flash of color when the sports organizationposted a celebratory video on their verified Instagram accountof her declaring, “We’re going to the Super Bowl!” after the Patriots secured their place by defeating the Denver Broncos during the AFC Championship game last week. Cardi B’s eye-catching coif was accompanied by a massive fur coat when she talked to NFL Network reporter Cameron Wolfe about Diggs and how he fought his way to the Super Bowl. “I’m feeling very excited, and very happy for him, very proud of him,”she said.“You know, he just came back from an ACL and me seeing the progress and the process of him going from there, from the first time he started running back and now joining the Patriots and actually going to the Super Bowl. I’m very excited for him, very excited for the whole team.” The star’s transformation into a football superfan has helped her to be ubiquitous of late, from hanging with Patriots owner Robert Kraft toher reported upcoming performanceat Michael Rubin’s Fanatics Super Bowl Party planned to be held in San Francisco the day prior to Super Bowl LX. But it’s the belief that Bad Bunny will bring her out for the halftime show that has many most excited. Not only have the pair collaborated before along with fellow Latin artist J Balvin on Cardi B’s hit 2018 single “I Like It,” but four years later, Bad Bunny ended the US leg of his “World’s Hottest Tour” by having Cardi join him on stage at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. She was so impressed by it all that she tweeted about it. “I was just at this stadium for the super bowl not long ago ..There’s more people here today at bad Bunny’s concert then the Super Bowl! …….Literally artist goal !!!!!”she wrote at the time. It would therefore be somewhat prophetic of Cardi B should she end up on the actual Super Bowl stage this weekend with Bad Bunny.",2026-02-02T12:00:46.437Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/entertainment/cardi-b-super-bowl,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258187262.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:27:19
Some of ‘Star Search’s’ biggest losers became megastars. Can the revival live up to its past?,"“America’s Got Talent,” “The Voice,” “American Idol” — would any of them exist without “Star Search?” The iconic staple of ’80s and ’90s television laid the groundwork for today’s ubiquitous talent competition shows, with one big exception: When it came to crowning big stars, it had a tendency to get things wrong. Everyone from Britney Spears to Justin Timberlake to Aaliyah appeared on the show — and lost, as did future 35-time Grammy winnerBeyoncé, whocompetedin 1993 as part of an all-girls group called Girls Tyme. “Can you believe it?” William Pilipchuk, lead singer of rock group Skeleton Crew, which bested Girls Tyme in a moment immortalized on Beyoncé’s single “***Flawless,” told CNN. “I’m the only singer that beat Beyoncé in a contest on national television.” The band’s guitarist Scott Christy recalled going backstage after the judges advanced their all-male, all-acoustic rock band to the next round over the preteens of Girls Tyme. “There were tears,” Christy told CNN. “It was horrible. I just felt bad.” Now, “Star Search” is back, this time on Netflix, with actor Anthony Anderson as host. The new incarnation – the second reboot after CBS’s failed 2003 attempt – is buzzier, bigger, live and flashier. But its somewhat nonsensical pairings remain, as in a recent episode that featured a trapeze artist duo going up against a trainer doing a dance routine with her dog. The revival is off to aslow start. It remains to be seen who, if any, of the first batch of contestants – which which includes several magicians and a singing comic, among others – will become America’s next big star. But as the winners and losers of the past know, the results of “Star Search” often have little to do with what they find after. Singer and songwriterKatrina Woolvertonhad her chance at stardom in 1989. Heron-screen competitionin the junior vocalist category was a 10-year-old singer who belted a version of “My Funny Valentine.” Her name was Aaliyah. In an interview with CNN, Woolverton remembered Aaliyah as having a “quiet manner about her” and that she was “a little more reserved but incredibly talented.” Woolverton wound up besting Aaliyah and went on to become the round one junior vocalist champion. The loss didn’t keep Aalyiah down. Just five years later, she released her debut album, “Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number.” Woolverton’s music pursuits panned out differently. After the show, she received offers from record labels but ultimately left the music industry after facing some adversity at home, opting to focus on her education instead. She eventually returned to music as an EDM artist, which is her focus today. Aaliyah, meanwhile, went on to release three studio albums following her debut, spawning five top 10 hits that charted on theBillboard Hot 100.Widely regarded as one of the most promising artists of her time, her untimelydeathin a plane crash in 2001 cut short her meteoric rise. “There’s no sweetness in that victory because she’s not here anymore,” said Woolverton. “I always thought I’d have the chance to cross paths with her and congratulate her and just tell her, ‘I was so proud of you to see that you did it.’” Mega fame didn’t findSkeleton Crewafter “Star Search,” but the band didn’t do too bad for themselves. They got a record deal and had a chance to tour in support of artists like Foreigner and Kenny Loggins. They only found out later that their success came from what one of the most influential artists of the century once called a “defining moment” of her childhood. Beyoncé directly addressed her loss, alongside Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett, 30 years after it happened,sayingin 2013: “You’re never too good to lose, you’re never too big to lose, you’re never too smart to lose. It happens. And it happens when it needs to happen and you need to embrace those things.” The same year, she featured footage of the moment in hermusic videofor “***Flawless.” Skeleton Crew reached out after the single dropped, and Pilipchuk admits he still has a “bitter taste” that he never got a reply from Beyoncé or her team. Skeleton Crew disbanded in 1995, and Pilipchuk and Christy now perform in a band called The Crystal Set. Pilipchuk insists he is still largely unfazed by the fact that he and Skeleton Crew have any connection to Beyoncé’s meteoric rise. Christy has a softer view, crediting the experience as “the gift that keeps on giving back to us.” The original “Star Search” debuted on CBS with famed TV personality Ed McMahon as the host in 1983 and aired until 1995. Considered the first talent competition reality show, it featured head-to-head match-ups in categories including solo and group vocalist, comedy, spokesmodel and dance. Netflix’s updated version nods to its predecessor with its voting, allowing for judges Chrissy Teigen, Jelly Roll and Sarah Michelle Gellar to hand out up to five stars. The live format also lets viewers act as the fourth judge by voting in real time. ForMarty Thomas, a Broadway vet who competed against Britney Spears in 1992’s junior vocalist competition, the experience on the show was so profoundly positive that he hopes the revival captures some of that magic for its new slate of young stars. “When you’re rebooting something like ‘Star Search’ that so many people hold such a soft spot in their heart for from the ‘80s, I really hope they’re able to at least strive to capture a little of that innocence and that reality,” Thomas told CNN, fresh off a string of cruise ship performances. Innocence is a good word for it. After competing against one another on “Star Search,” Thomas, Spears and their families went on to become friends in the years that followed. He and Spears even attended the same performing arts school in New York City, and he was part of the pop singer’s life until the mid-2000s, bearing witness to her meteoric rise. Ultimately, he observed, her rejection on “Star Search” did not have that much of a negative impact “beyond breaking her heart.” If anything, Thomas continued, the experience just “strengthened her resolve to keep working harder and try new things.” “Star Search,” of course, isn’t the only reality competition show to reject greatness (here’s looking at you,Jennifer Hudson, EGOT). The reboot is, however, leaning into that notion that even if you lose, you win. Perhaps Anderson put it best when he bid farewell to the trainer and her dog after the trapeze artists knocked them out, saying, “now the whole world knows who you are.”",2026-01-28T18:24:28.461Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/28/entertainment/star-search-beyonce-britney-aaliyah-skeleton-crew,Alli Rosenbloom,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1297834258.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:27:41
Actor Paul Dano responds to Quentin Tarantino’s criticism of him,"ActorPaul Danohas broken his silence aboutQuentin Tarantino’sharsh criticism of him. The “Pulp Fiction” director launched a scathing attack on Dano during an interview with “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast” in an episode released last month. During the conversation, Tarantino said his fifth favorite film of the 21st century was “There Will Be Blood” – but he added a caveat. He said the 2007 movie, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, would have been his first or second favorite were it not for “a big giant flaw in it, and the flaw is Paul Dano.” Adding insult to injury, he went on to describe Dano as “such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy.” Dano, who played two roles in the movie as identical twins Eli and Paul Sunday, didn’t publicly address the director’s comments, although some of Hollywood’s biggest stars jumped to his defense. Now, a reporter fromVarietyhas asked Dano at a 20th anniversary screening of “Little Miss Sunshine” at the Sundance Film Festival about Tarantino’s outburst. Although Dano did not speak directly to Tarantino’s comments, he said of the support he’d received: “That was really nice. I was also incredibly grateful that the world spoke up for me so I didn’t have to.” Dano has received support from some of Hollywood’s biggest names. Toni Collette, who starred alongside Dano in the Oscar-winning movie “Little Miss Sunshine,” said in the article published Wednesday: “Are we really going there? F**k that guy (Tarantino).” She added: “Who does that?” Meanwhile, actor and director Ben Stiller posted onXlast month: “Paul Dano is f-ing brilliant.” And Reese Witherspoon said onThreads: “Paul Dano is an incredibly gifted, versatile actor. More importantly, he is a gentleman.” During his speech for best actor at the AARP awards earlier this month, George Clooney said: “I don’t enjoy watching people be cruel to actors,” adding that he would be “honored” to work with Dano. George Clooney has some choice words for Quentin Tarantino, who said he doesn’t think Clooney is a movie star The “Little Miss Sunshine” directors also sprang to Dano’s defense this week. Jonathan Dayton told Variety that Tarantino’s comments were an “embarrassment,” adding: “I can only think that his (Dano’s) rawness of his performance made Tarantino uncomfortable.” Valerie Faris added: “You know what was interesting was the people coming out to defend Paul … he is loved by so many. He is so smart.” CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.",2026-01-29T11:04:20.177Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/entertainment/paul-dano-reacts-quentin-tarantino-criticism-scli-intl,Lianne Kolirin,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20260129-dano-tarantino-split.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:27:57
David and Victoria Beckham family drama pulls in a generation unafraid to go ‘no contact’,"For a few hours this week, it felt like the world and all its horrors stopped with one subject taking over the internet: Brooklyn Peltz Beckham. People feasted on every morsel after the eldest child of David and Victoria Beckham dropped six slides on his Instagram Stories accusing his famous parents of planting stories in the media about him, portraying “inauthentic relationships” on social media and trying to ruin his wedding to his wife, Nicola Peltz. Peltz Beckham launched his broadside with a statement of purpose: “I do not want to reconcile with my family.” With that, though he didn’t use the term himself, Peltz Beckham entered the fervent discourse shaking Gen Z and their Gen X and Boomer parents: going “no contact,” or dropping those family members deemed too toxic and incapable of change. In private conversations and very publicly on TikTok, the idea of going “no contact” is debated from all sides. On the one hand are those who choose to drop relationships — often hailed by their peers for choosing themselves over whatever situation led to the fissure. On the other are the parents who have been banished by their children, some expressing confusion, and others findingtheir own influencer lanein telling their side of the story. Karl Pillemer, a professor of human development at Cornell and author of the book “Fault Lines: Fractured Families and How to Mend Them,” told CNN that though there is a heightened awareness about adult children going no contact, thanks in part to social media, there is no actual hard data to show that there has been an increase. Back in 2020, Pillemer told the Cornell Chronicle he “found that 27% of Americans 18 and older had cut off contact with a family member, most of whom reported that they were upset by such a rift.” What he now sees at play is that younger people, including Gen Z, are receiving more support on social media when they decide to break with their families, even as their parents struggle to understand the language their kids are using to express why it’s happening, like “gaslighting” and “narcissistic parenting.” “For one, there’s social media encouragement that has become more acceptable,” Pillemer said. “Two, there’s this kind of disconnect between what some young people seem to expect from the parent-child relationship that is very different from their parents’ understanding of what they were doing.” No longer, he said, do adult children have to stay connected to their family because “blood is thicker than water” as the younger generation has “less of a feeling that I will live with this relationship if it isn’t fulfilling no matter what.” When it comes to the Beckhams, the educator said he was reminded of a conversation he had on an episode of the “Sibling Rivalry” podcast, hosted by celebrity siblings Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson, about negotiating family relationships via social media. “I would say this is not a good way to handle estrangements,” he said “It draws an incredibly powerful line in the sand when you out the entire relationship. And it’s very difficult then, ‘cause those things live forever.” Another part of the draw to the Beckham scandal is the behind the scenes glance it gives into a powerhouse celebrity family. From the love-at-first-sight moment footballer David Beckham met then-Spice Girls singer Victoria Adams during a 1997 soccer game, the couple seemed to be living a fairytale. Their firstborn was an integral part of their love story. Named for the New York City borough where his parents discovered they were expecting him, he was the four-month-old ring bearer at their 1999 nuptials at Luttrellstown Castle in Dublin, Ireland. As he grew older, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham seemed to work hard at finding his niche. He’s been a barista, a model, a photographer and an aspiring chef complete with his own line of hot sauces. The celebrity progeny appeared to be seeking out his place in a world that had been aware of him since birth. He touched on the subject in “What I See,” a book of his photographs published in 2017, when he was 18. “I don’t think being in the public eye has affected me too much. I’m just used to it,”he reportedly said at the time.“Obviously I have to be more aware as a teenager that someone may be capturing shots of me unaware.” His father also touched on it in a 2023 Netflix docuseries, “Beckham,” at one point getting emotional when talking about his four children. “We’ve tried to give our children the most normal possible upbringing as possible,” the elder Beckham said. “But you’ve got a dad that was England captain and you’ve got mum who was Posh Spice.” The family also includes sons Romeo and Cruz and daughter Harper. “And they could be little s**ts, and they’re not,” he added. “And that’s why I say I’m so proud of my children.” That public perception shifted this week when Peltz Beckham took to Instagram, criticizing his parents’ “performative social media posts” and saying the facade has “been a fixture of the life I was born into.” CNN has reached out to representatives for the Beckhams for comment. The Beckham family feud previously lived only in the pages of tabloids and on social media, where there were tales of tension between the Beckhams and their eldest progeny and his wife. Rumors began swirling shortly after Beckham, 26, married Peltz, 31, at a ceremony in Palm Beach in April 2022, to which the bride wore a Valentino Couture dress – not a gown designed by her soon-to-be mother-in-law, a fashion mogul. There was so much gossip that the newest member of the Beckham familygave an interview to The Sunday Times in October 2022denying that she was at odds with her in-laws. “I don’t know why they say feud?,” she told the paper. “I mean, maybe they picked up on something? And now they’re labelling it feud? No family is perfect!” Brooklyn Peltz Beckham revealed how far from perfect by posting this week with a slew of accusations against his family. “I’m standing up for myself for the first time in my life,” Peltz Beckham wrote. It was a direct move from a young man who many believe has had a soft life since the very beginning. But it is just that perception of him having lived the “good life” that aided in captivating the interest of the public, who were given a stark reminder that even in the spotlight, a family split can still be devastating.",2026-01-22T21:06:57.000Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/22/entertainment/david-beckham-victoria-brooklyn-no-contact,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2243112724.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:28:09
"What you missed at the 2026 Grammys: Politics, nudity and appearances by legends","Bad BunnyandKendrick Lamar, two artists unafraid to hold a mirror up to America through their music and performances, dominated theGrammy Awardson Sunday night. Bad Bunny made history when he won album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos)” – the firstSpanish-language albumto achieve the top honor – while Lamar also broke records with five wins, including best rap album and record of the year, becoming the most-awarded rap artist in Grammy history. Bad Bunny got emotional after winning the night’s top prize, making his way to the stage with tears in his eyes before acknowledging his homeland of Puerto Rico and dedicating his win to “all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams.” He made a more pointedanti-ICE statementearlier in the evening while accepting the Grammy for best música urbana album. “We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans,” Bad Bunny said, after deploying the phrase “ICE out,” which has been used as a call for an end to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Next Sunday, Bad Bunny will take to theSuper Bowl Halftime Showstage for a performance that has been marked by anticipation and criticism from conservatives. Lamar knows what that feels like. He was theperformer for Super Bowl LIXand used his time on sports’ biggest stage to deliver a politically-charged performance that featured Samuel L. Jackson dressed as Uncle Sam. The Grammy Awards weren’t just about political statements, however. There were several stand-out performances and tributes to beloved musicians who passed last year and so much more. Here are some of the night’s other notable moments. Cher appeared to have something resembling a“La La Land” momentwhile presenting Kendrick Lamar and SZA with the record of the year Grammy, when she misread the envelope, awarding the Grammy to the late Luther Vandross, whose first name is the title of the song that was awarded. This plus some teleprompter issues made for an awkward moment. In her defense, she tried to walk off stage after accepting her lifetime achievement award. So, maybe she knew this wasn’t the job for a legend like her. Television censors couldn’t keep up with Lola Young’s excitement over winning best pop solo performance, failing to properly bleep a four-letter expletive that escaped her mouth during her acceptance speech. The button was ready to go, however, for Billie Eilish’s acceptance speech for song of the year, during which said “F**k ICE,” according to videos posted to social media by those in the crowd. Fun fact: Eilish and her brother and collaborator Finneas became the first songwriting duo to win three times in the category. As if Steven Spielberg needed another Hollywood accolade, the famed director achieved EGOT status after he scored a Grammy win during the Grammys preshow on Sunday. Spielberg won a Grammy in the best music film category for “Music by John Williams,” on which Spielberg is credited as a producer. This marks his first Grammy. Spielberg has won three Academy Awards, one Tony and four Emmys. The in-memoriam segment fittingly had a touch of metal this year, with a performance in honor of the late Ozzy Osbourne. With Slash on guitar, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith on percussion and Post Malone singing the vocals, the ensemble played a cover of Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs” to honor the band’s late leader. The moment was an emotional one, with the camera cutting to the fallen rocker’s family, Sharon, Kelly and Jack Osbourne, who were all seen tearfully watching the performance. Lauryn Hill subsequently took the stage to perform a medley of her greatest hits, and paid tribute toD’Angelo, who died in October. Earlier, country superstar Reba McEntire launched the in-memoriam segment by singing “Trailerblazer” alongside Brandy Clark and Lukas Nelson, in what was McEntire’s first-ever performance at the Grammys. McEntire’s stepson Brandon Blackstock, a talent agent and Kelly Clarkson’s former husband,died in Augustand was honored during the segment. The Dalai Lama is a Grammy winner. The spiritual leader was awarded the honor for the audio book that accompanied his title “Meditations: The Reflections of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.” Host Trevor Noah was also nominated in the category. In a statementposted to Instagram, the Dalai Lama wrote that he accepted the award “with gratitude and humility.” No shirt? No problem — at least at the Grammys. Chappell Roan stepped onto the red carpet wearing a sheer burgundy frock, with its top components held up solely by the hoops of what appeared to be nipple rings. Doechii channeled “Death Becomes Her” in a bejeweled chest piece that probably stressed out the sound operator at the Grammys when it jangled in the mic, and Teyana Taylor floated into the show wearing an abdomen-bearing sparkly gold gown. Justin Bieber also took a note from the skin-loving ladies, wearing only a pair of silvery blue silk boxers for his first performance on the Grammys stage in four years. Whether they were performing on stage – looking at you sombr, Addison Rae and Alex Warren – or accepting an award like best new artist winner Olivia Dean, the musicians of TikTok had a great night. The same can be said for artists whose older songs felt new again because they happened to find new listeners on the popular social media network. You might know that Sabrina Carpenter’s “Manchild” came out in June 2025, but it was new to some! In a night that made history all around,one record-breaking moment came from the world of K-Pop. The infectious and uplifting anthem “Golden” from the surprise Netflix hit movie “K-Pop Demon Hunters” scored a pre-telecast Grammy win on Sunday, when it clinched the award for best song written for visual media. The banger, sung byEJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami of HUNTR/X, was nominated for four Grammys total this weekend, including song of the year. Lady Gaga delivered a powerful speech after winning a Grammy in the pop vocal album category, using her time on stage to encourage women in music to “always listen to yourself and always fight for your ideas” when they’re in the studio, which can sometimes be a male-dominated space. “Fight for yourself as a producer and make sure that you are heard – loudly,” she added.

Bad Bunny uses Grammy Award win to protest ICE,"One week before he’s set to headline theSuper Bowl LX halftime showand on a night when he made Grammys history, Bad Bunny used his time on stage to deliver a pointed political message that protested the recent actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Accepting the award for best música urbana album, Bad Bunny began his speech saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out!” The crowd inside the show, which took place in Los Angeles, overwhelmingly responded with cheers, according to what was heard on the telecast. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens,” he said. “We are humans and we are Americans.” The most striking looks from the Grammys red carpet After pausing while the audience applauded, Bad Bunny continued: “I know it’s tough not to hate on these days, and I was thinking, sometimes we getcontaminados– I don’t know how to say that in English – the hate gets more powerful with more hate.” “The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love,” he said. “So, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.” The phrase “ICE out” has been used at protests as a call for an end to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Bad Bunny won a total of three awards on Sunday, one of which was a history-making win for album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos).” It is the first time a Spanish-language album has claimed the Recording Academy’s top prize. During his emotional acceptance speech, delivered mostly in Spanish, Bad Bunny dedicated his win to “all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country to follow their dreams.” Bad Bunny’s comments come amid nationwide anti-ICE protests that took place over the weekend. On Friday,Bruce Springsteenmade a surprise appearance at a concert organized by Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello in Minneapolis, an event that benefitted the families ofRenee Nicole GoodandAlex Pretti, who were both killed by federal officers last month. Springsteen released a song last week titled “Streets of Minneapolis,” which he dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, as well as Good and Pretti’s memory. Billie Eilish also spoke out against ICE on stage at the Grammys, but viewers at home did not hear the full extent of her comments. While accepting the Grammy for song of the year for “Wildflower,” Eilish, who has been an outspoken critic of actions made by ICE officials in recent weeks, said “no one is illegal on stolen land.” “It’s just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,” she continued, going on to encourage everyone to “keep fighting and speaking up and protesting.” The end of her speech was bleeped by television censors but, according to video footage posted online, Eilish said, “F**k ICE.” Earlier in the telecast, best new artist winner Olivia Dean also made a politically-tinged statement on stage. The British singer and songwriter, who has Caribbean roots, acknowledged during her acceptance speech that she is the “granddaughter of an immigrant.” “I’m a product of bravery, and I think that those people deserve to be celebrated,” she said. “We’re nothing without each other.” Grammys host Trevor Noah took a more lighthearted approach to commenting on the state of the union. During his opening monologue, he made a joke about rapper Nicki Minaj – who recently called herself President Donald Trump’s “number one fan” – was not at the Grammys because she was “still at the White House discussing very important issues.” Trump later shared his thoughts on the telecast on Truth Social, calling the Grammy Awards “virtually unwatchable.” Noah also did a bit with Bad Bunny prior to the musician’s win, asking if he could live in Puerto Rico if things keep getting worse in America. “Well, I have some news for you,” Bad Bunny said. “Puerto Rico is part of America.” Bad Bunny’s comments will likely fan the flames of controversy that have dominated the conversation around his halftime performance since his selection was announced. Some in conservative circles have been opposed to his appearance on sports’ biggest stage since it was announced, stemming from the fact heexcluded the continental United Statesfrom his 2025-2026 concert tour, a decision he said he made out of fear that ICE could potentially raid the concert venues. Others on the right have been critical of Bad Bunny’s music catalogue, which exclusively contains Spanish songs. Conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA created counter-programming to Bad Bunny’s Halftime Show performance that the organization says is more aligned with their values. The lineup of performers has not been confirmed.",2026-02-02T03:26:41.480Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/01/entertainment/bad-bunny-grammys-speech-ice,"Sandra Gonzalez, Alli Rosenbloom",entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2259486677.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:28:31
Claire Danes says she freaked out when she found she was pregnant at 44,"Claire Daneshas said she went into “meltdown” when she discovered she waspregnantwith her third child at age 44. The “Homeland” star revealed that she burst into tears when she found out she and her husband, the actorHugh Dancy, were expecting their third child. Speaking toAmy Poehlerfor her podcastGood Hang, the actress said: “I called my ob-gyn in convulsive tears. It was a pure … it was all meltdown.” It was not just Danes’ age that made the news a surprise but the fact that she had previously struggled to conceive. “None of this was by design,” she said, adding that her three children are all five years apart. “I didn’t know it was physically possible — I was 44. And actually Rowan (Danes’ second son) was very hard-earned. I had to do two rounds of IVF. It just was so unlikely.” Danes, who shot to fame starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann’s 1996 “Romeo + Juliet,” told Poehler that she had been at a spa with a close friend, to whom she confided her suspicion that she might be pregnant. “I wasn’t going to say anything and finally I admitted it,” she told Poehler, saying that she said to her friend: “I totally lost my mind last night and just decided I was pregnant. I went down this crazy rabbit hole and finally looked up what are the odds of naturally conceiving at 44 and they’re like less than 1% one per cent.’ I was like ‘so that obviously is ridiculous.” In response, her friend revealed that she had had a dream that she herself was pregnant — but was in Danes’ body. Celebrities like Pedro Pascal and Billie Eilish begin to condemn deadly shootings in Minneapolis amid ICE surge Danes recalled that she had “two strong cocktails” and the following day took a test. “It was like bold, cap lock PREGNANT and I burst into tears,” she said. “And then this beautiful girl emerged and she’s the best and none of it was up to me and I’m just delighted,” she said. Although it is not the first time that Danes has spoken of her surprise at becoming pregnant — when she appeared on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in 2023 she said “this one was a surprise” — it is the first time she has revealed her daughter’s name: Shay. Earlier in her chat with Poehler, Danes said of her daughter, who was born in July 2023: “Shay, my baby, she’s very kind of in her head and dreamy.” Back in November, in an interview with Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett on theSmartlesspodcast, Danes said her pregnancy experience was “really interesting.” She explained: “It was weird — suddenly I felt, like, a funny shame … like I was naughty. Like I had been caught fornicating past the point I was meant to.” Danes and British actor Dancy first met in 2007 on the set of the romantic drama film “Evening,” and they married in 2009. She was recently nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance in the Netflix series “The Beast in Me.”",2026-01-28T13:27:18.580Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/28/entertainment/claire-danes-freaked-out-third-pregnancy-scli-intl,Lianne Kolirin,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2022-04-25t175113z-454335749-rc26tt9ih9mr-rtrmadp-3-film-downton-abbey-a-new-era-premiere.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:28:43
‘War of the Worlds’ and ‘Snow White’ remakes lead the Razzies,"It’s time to celebrate the best of the worst in movies. Two remakes top the list of the 46th Annual Golden Raspberry nominations, known as the Razzies, announced on Wednesday. “War of the Worlds,” which like the 2005 film of the same name starring Tom Cruise is based on H. G. Wells’s 1898 novel “The War of the Worlds,” racked up 6 nominations. Ice Cube was nominated in the worst actor category for his performance as William Radford, a Department of Homeland Security officer who reckons with a potentially apocalyptic alien invasion. Disney’s “Snow White,” a live-action remake of Disney’s 1937 animated film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” also nabbed 6 nominations. A worst supporting actor nod went to “All Seven Artificial Dwarfs” in the film. The awards take a tongue in cheek approach to cinema by handing out awards for those films that are, shall we say, viewed as less than stellar. As is tradition, the “winners” are announced the day before the Academy Awards ceremony. The following is the full list of nominees for the Razzies: Ice Cube and His Zoom Camera / “War of the Worlds” (2025) Robert DeNiro and Robert DeNiro (as Frank & Vito) / “The Alto Knights” The Weeknd and His Colossal Ego / “Hurry Up Tomorrow” “The Electric State” / Screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Adapted from the illustrated novel by Simon Stalenhag “Hurry Up Tomorrow” / Screenplay by Trey Edward Shults, Abel Tesfaye, Reza Fahim “Snow White” (2025) / Screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson and a bunch of others too numerous to mention.

Thousands of fans celebrate life of legendary Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir in San Francisco,"Thousands of people gathered Saturday at San Francisco’s Civic Center to celebrate the life of Bob Weir, the legendary guitarist and founding member of the Grateful Dead who died last weekat age 78. Musicians Joan Baez and John Mayer spoke on a makeshift stage in front of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium after four Buddhist monks opened the event with a prayer in Tibetan. Fans carried long-stemmed red roses, placing some at an altar filled with photos and candles. They wrote notes on colored paper, professing their love and thanking him for the journey. Several asked him to say hello to fellow singer and guitaristJerry Garciaand bass guitaristPhil Lesh, also founding members who preceded him in death. Garcia died in 1995; Lesh died in 2024. “I’m here to celebrate Bob Weir,” said Ruthie Garcia, who is no relation to Jerry, a fan since 1989. “Celebrating him and helping him go home.” Saturday’s celebration brought plenty of fans with long dreadlocks and wearing tie-dye clothing, some using walkers. But there were also young couples, men in their 20s and a father who brought his 6-year-old son in order to pass on to the next generation a love of live music and the tight-knit Deadhead community. The Bay Area native joined theGrateful Dead— originally the Warlocks — in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including “Sugar Magnolia,” “One More Saturday Night” and “Mexicali Blues.” He was generally considered less shaggy looking than the other band members, although he adopted a long beard like Garcia’s later in life. The Dead played music that pulled in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams. Their concerts attracted avid Deadheads who followed them on tours. The band played on decades after Garcia’s death, morphing intoDead & Companywith John Mayer. Darla Sagos, who caught an early flight out of Seattle Saturday morning to make the public mourning, said she suspected something was up when there were no new gigs announced after Dead & Company played three nights in San Francisco last summer. It was unusual, as his calendar often showed where he would be playing next. “We were hoping that everything was OK and that we were going to get more music from him,” she said. “But we will continue the music, with all of us and everyone that’s going to be playing it.” Sagos and her husband, Adam Sagos, have a one-year-old grandson who will grow up knowing the music. A statement on Weir’s Instagram account announced his passing Jan. 10. It said he beat cancer, but he succumbed to underlying lung issues. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, who were at Saturday’s event. His death was sudden and unexpected, said daughter Monet Weir, but he had always wished for the music and the legacy of the Dead to outlast him. American music, he believed, could unite, she said.",2026-01-18T05:51:43.077Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/18/entertainment/bob-weir-memorial-grateful-dead-hnk,Associated Press,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256818001.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:08
"Phil Collins says he has 24-hour live-in nurse care, as he details health struggles","Phil Collinshas opened up about his recent health challenges, revealing that he has 24-hour live-in nurse care. The British rock star said that “everything that could go wrong with me, did go wrong with me” in recent years. The former Genesis frontman, who turns 75 on January 30, was speaking to British presenter Zoe Ball for the final part of BBC podcast series “Eras” about his illustrious career. He told Ball that he’s had five operations on his knee. “I can walk, albeit with assistance,” he said. “I have a 24-hour, live-in nurse to make sure I take my medication as I should do,” said Collins, who first shot to fame in the 1970s. “I’ve had challenges with my knee, I had everything that could go wrong with me, did go wrong with me. I got Covid in hospital, my kidneys started to back up,” said the singer-songwriter, drummer and record producer. “I’d probably been drinking too much, and so my kidneys were messed up,” he added. “I wasn’t one of those guys that sort of stayed up all night drinking. I’d drink during the day, but I guess I had too much of it.” “It is just one of those things that happened and it all caught up with me and I spent months in hospital.” Collins said he hoped to get “back to being totally mobile and healthy,” though he was unsure if he would ever get to perform live again – his last concert was in 2022. Despite his poor health, Collins struck a note of positivity. “I couldn’t have wished for a more varied and eventful playing career,” he said. Collins has previously spoken about his failing health. In a2021 interview, he said he couldn’t play the drums any longer. His son Nic Collins replaced him on drums for a Genesis reunion tour, while he stuck to the vocals. He’s had a series of fractures over the years and in 2015 underwent back surgery, which left him with nerve damage. In 2017, he fell,which resultedin him using a cane to assist with walking. Collins, who is three-times divorced, is father to four other children besides Nic. His daughter, Lily Collins, is the protagonist of hit Netflix show “Emily in Paris.” Asked by Ball what life had taught him, Collins said there’s a part of him “that’s trying to make up for things that I’ve either done or have made people feel. Or affected the kids in any kind of negative way.” Nevertheless, he added: “My kids are amazingly well-adjusted considering some of the things that they’ve been through. I’m very, very proud of all of them. They’ve all stood on their own and done what they believe in.” The interview, a preview of which was sent to media, is the fifth and final instalment of the series. A television version of the interview will air on the BBC on January 31.",2026-01-22T16:20:16.418Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/22/entertainment/phil-collins-health-challenges-scli-intl,Lianne Kolirin,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01kfgb7086nezrqqy98evjr47c.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:20
Celebrities like Pedro Pascal and Billie Eilish begin to condemn deadly shootings in Minneapolis amid ICE surge,"The silence that has largely blanketed Hollywood since the Trump administration deployed thousands of federal agents to Minneapolis appeared to crack this weekend in the wake of the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Two celebrities known for speaking their values — “The Last of Us” star Pedro Pascal and singer Billie Eilish — were among the loudest. Pascal shared multiple posts to his Instagram Sunday night drawing attention to the killing of both Pretti and Renee Good, who was fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis on January 7. One of Pascal’s postsincluded drawings of Pretti and Good with the words “Pretti Good reason for a national strike” along with snippets from a New York Times editorial titled “Two People Are Dead. Americans Deserve to Know the Truth.” Actress Jamie Lee Curtisshared the same image on Instagram.Actor Edward Norton, speaking to the Los Angeles Times at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, alsocalled fora general strike. Writing on Instagram, Pascal said: “Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and authoritarian regime. Mr Pretti and Renee Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.” He also tagged the New York Times. On Instagram, Eilish posted to her stories several times, including one calling Pretti “a real American hero.” Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, wasrepeatedly shotafter being tackled by federal agents in a confrontation caught on video. Eilish called out the overwhelming silence from many of America’s cultural luminaries, posting a selfie with the words: “hey my fellow celebrities u gonna speak up? or” By Monday morning, singer Katy Perry wasurgingher Instagram followers to write to their senators. The slow roll began over the weekend, as Natalie Portman and Olivia Wilde appeared at Sundance wearing pins reading “ICE Out,” which werealso donnedby several actors at the Golden Globes earlier this month. “I could not be prouder to be American right now, by the way the Americans are acting. And I could not be sadder to be American right now with the way the government is behaving,” Portman, whose film “The Gallerist” is opening at the festival, toldDeadline. Speaking on the Sundance red carpet, WildetoldThe Associated Press she was “horrified” by the deaths at the hands of federal agents and that she believed many Americans were as well. “I think it’s appalling,” said Wilde, in Sundance to promote “The Invite,” which she both stars in and directs. “It’s really difficult to be here and to be celebrating something so joyous and beautiful and positive when we know what’s happening on the streets. Americans are out on the streets marching and demanding justice and we’re there with them.” Elsewhere, actors Mark Ruffalo and Glenn Close, no strangers to speaking out, also condemned the violence by federal agents. “Alex Pretti is a hero,” Ruffalowroteon Bluesky, resharing a post about Pretti being a nurse with the Veterans Administration and a dog owner. Prior to thathe also shared a link to the video of Pretti being shot, writing: “Cold blooded murder in the streets of the USA by an occupying military gang, creating havoc. We have fought wars in other countries for less than this.” On Instagram, Closereadfrom prepared remarks, saying that while she has been mostly out of the country since September, she has “watched, with the rest of the world, our democracy being systematically disemboweled and torn apart.” “I am outraged and sickened by what is happening under the Trump regime: the cruelty, inhumanity, and arrogance,” she said. “The voracious corruption, the cowardice, the sickening hypocrisy, the blatant manipulation of facts, and now the cold-blooded murder of American citizens.” Close ended her remarks by saying she believed “the great American body politic is stirring, waking up and taking in what’s going on.” “And, mark my words, there will be hell to pay,” she concluded.",2026-01-26T18:38:08.485Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/entertainment/celebrities-against-ice-immigration-violence-minneapolis,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-12-02t031625z-201890137-rc228iailxn7-rtrmadp-3-film-avatar-premiere.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:31
"The Golden Globes were calm, scripted and largely apolitical amid a world on fire","Perhaps the 83rd Annual Golden Globes decided to lean into dry January. The annual awards show is known for having flowing booze, which often helps lubricate the acceptance speeches, but things were oddly calm this year. Absent were any sloppy moments or off-the-cuff interactions. Winners were also largely quiet on the political situation inside the country, giving the whole thing a muted tone. Has the awards show become more conservative or was Hollywood simply leaning into the joy the world desperately seems to need right now? In the olden days, celebs would wear sunglasses inside the show — more to hide their clear enjoyment of the libations than to look cool. Jack Nicholson was wearing a pair when he announced “I took a valium tonight” back in 2003. A decade later, hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler held their own drinks up to the camera while Fey joked, “Look how drunk Glenn Close is,” as noted in avideoby The Wrap titled “Drunken Globes: One Minute of ‘Golden’ Boozy Moments.” And who can forget Cate Blanchett’sadmissionafter winning best actress in a drama for “Blue Jasmine” in 2014 that since her “category came up rather later in the evening,” she was “a couple of sheets to the wind.” CNN’s Stephanie Elam was in the room Sunday night and said that while she saw a few stars with “wobbly footsteps” towards the end of the show, it was more about folks catching up and making sure to hit the side room for sushi, dessert and cocktails. The muted vibe might track with the turmoil outside the ballroom, as the country reckons with thekillingof Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, President Donald Trump’sassaulton Venezuela and spiralingprotestsin Iran. While some — including Ariana Grande, Natasha Lyonne and Tessa Thompson — wore “Be Good” or “ICE Out” pins in the wake of Good’s killing, statements were relegated to the red carpet. Actor Mark Ruffalo, who was nominated for best male actor in a television drama for his work in “Task,”told USA Todaythat the pin was for Good and “the people in the United States who are terrorized and scared today.” “I know I’m one of ‘em,” he said on the red carpet. “I love this country and what I’m seeing here happening is not America.” “We’re in the middle of a war with Venezuela that we illegally invaded,” said Ruffalo, who is known to use social media to speak his mind about politics. “He’s telling the world that international law doesn’t matter to him.” Asked on the red carpet about shooting the latest season of “Hacks,” Jean Smarttold“Entertainment Tonight” that “everything is a little bit overshadowed with everything that’s going on in our country.” “I feel like we’re kind of at a turning point in our country, and I hope people can keep their heads, because I think that’s actually going to be the hardest thing, to keep our heads,” she said. “But that’s going to take a lot of courage and a lot of restraint, but I think that’s important.” Smart pointed to her words during her acceptance speech after once again winning the best actress in a TV comedy award. “There’s so much that could be said tonight. I said my rant on the red carpet, so I won’t do it here,” she said on stage. “Let’s all do the right thing. I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do, so let’s do the right thing.” Host Nikki Glaser touched on some political issues during her opening monologue, getting in a jab about theEpstein files. “I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight, it’s insane. There’s so many A-listers. And by ‘A-listers’ I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted,” she joked. “Yes and the Golden Globe for best editing goes to … the Justice Department.” She also poked fun at CBS which hosted the show and has been under scrutiny after the new editor-in-chief of CBS News, Bari Weiss,shelveda “60 Minutes” story about Venezuelan men being deported by the Trump administration to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador. “And the award for ‘Most Editing’ goes to CBS News,” Glaser quipped Sunday night. “Yes, CBS News, America’s newest place to see BS news.” It was Glaser’s second time hosting the Golden Globes and like last year she leaned more heavily into teasing the talent and the industry than taking on politics, though even that schtick seemed kinder and gentler. This is a woman who managed to get Sean Penn to laugh at her saying “Everyone in this town is obsessed with looking younger, but Sean Penn is like, ‘What if I slowly morph into a sexy leather handbag?’” Penn is a man who has famously swung at paparazzi for less. One person who spoke their minds from the Beverly Hilton stage was Wanda Sykes while presenting the award for best stand-up comedy on TV to Ricky Gervais for his “Ricky Gervais: Mortality” Netflix special. Gervais was not there to accept the award and Sykes used the opportunity to “thank God and the trans community” on his behalf. Gervais is famously an atheist and has received backlash for comments he’s made about the trans community. For the record, last year’s Golden Globes weren’t super political either, but this year’s felt even more staid and family friendly. One of the most viral moments? “All Her Fault” star Duke McCloud on the red carpet talking about his tiny, tailored blue suit. The awards show may get that Generation Alpha viewership yet.",2026-01-12T17:14:41.556Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/12/entertainment/golden-globes-not-boozy-political,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2255252125-20260112124931534.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:29:42
Nigella Lawson to replace Prue Leith on ‘The Great British Baking Show’,"Celebrity chefNigella Lawsonis to join “The Great British Baking Show” as a judge, replacing the departingPrue Leith. The move was announced Monday in a statement from Channel 4, which airs the TV baking competition in the United Kingdom. It said it was “delighted to announce” Lawson’s arrival on the show, which is known as “The Great British Bake Off” in the UK. “Nigella’s expertise, empathy and humour are the perfect ingredients for the Bake Off tent,” the statement reads. Lawson said in the same statement that she is “bubbling with excitement” to take up the role, while acknowledging that it is “daunting to be following in the footsteps of Prue Leith and Mary Berry before her, great dames both.” “The Great British Bake Off is more than a television programme, it’s a National Treasure – and it’s a huge honour to be entrusted with it,” she added. Leith said she is “thrilled” that Lawson will take over her role as a judge. “She’s sassy, fun and she knows her onions — and her croissants, cake and crumble,” she said in the statement. Nigella Lawson butters her toast twice, and Britain is really angry about it Lawson, age 66, is herself something of a national treasure in the UK, where she is known to many simply as “Nigella” and credited with bringing new audiences to the world of cooking shows thanks to her flirtatious manner. Born in London, she is the daughter of former Chancellor of the Exchequer — or finance minister — Nigel Lawson. After studying at Oxford University, she began her career in publishing before moving into media, writing restaurant columns.

The legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has a new star and it is Taylor Swift,"The latest round of legal drama between actress Blake Lively and her “It Ends with Us” director Justin Baldoni offers incredible insight into the support network Lively relied on during and after the movie’s production — including one of her good friends, Taylor Swift. According to unsealed documents filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday and obtained by CNN, Lively spoke openly with friends about the trouble she allegedly experienced on the set of the 2024 movie, which she costarred in alongside Baldoni. Lively has accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and coordinating a “plan” to “destroy” her reputation, according to a suit filed against him and his production company, Wayfarer Studios. In one exchange with Swift, with whom she has had a longstanding friendship, Lively referred to Baldoni as her “doofus director,” according to the new filing. A year later, the two women texted about Baldoni again, according to the new filing, this time ahead of a New York Times story that burst open the drama on set for all the public to see. “I think this bitch knows something is coming because he’s gotten out his tiny violin,” Swift texted Lively, along with a screenshot of an Instagram post from People Magazine, highlighting comments from Baldoni about being “sexually traumatized” in his past, according to the legal documents. Swift likened the Lively/Baldoni situation to “a horror film no one knows is taking place,” the documents show. CNN has reached out to Swift’s representative for comment. “The newly unsealed evidence shows the concerns of Ms. Lively and others were documented in real-time as early as Spring 2023, and Wayfarer understood them as ‘sexual harassment’ concerns,” Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively’s legal team, said in a statement to CNN. “The evidence also documents how Wayfarer refused to investigate, but instead attempted to ‘bury’ Ms. Lively and others who spoke up through retaliation,” she said. Asked to comment on McCawley’s statement, Bryan Freedman, a lawyer for Baldoni and Wayfarer, said “the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law. A simple read of the newly released message exchanges make the truth abundantly clear. We remain confident in the legal process and clearing the names of all of the Justin Baldoni parties.” After the New York Times published itsarticle, “’We Can Bury Anyone’: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine,” Baldonifiled suitagainst the newspaper, alleging that the story was “rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions” and relied on Lively’s “self-serving narrative.” The story included contents from a Civil Rights Department complaint, typically kept confidential, that Lively had filed against Baldoni in December 2024 accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation against her. Lively then filed a suit against Baldoni. Baldoni followed with a $400 million suit against Lively and her superstar husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging defamation and that they both “hijacked” his film and were attempting to “destroy” his career. A judgedismissed Baldoni’s suits against Lively and Reynolds, as well as against the New York Times,in June 2025. Two months later, the New York Times filed suit against Wayfarer in an effort to recoup legal fees. In December 2025, Lively’s suit against Baldoni was postponed from a trial date of March 9 to May 18, 2026. Swift’s star power first entered the casein May 2025, when it was revealed that she had been subpoenaedafter text exchanges were revealed to include the name “Taylor” as part of Baldoni’s suit. Baldoni had sought to depose Swift, and requested more time to make that happen,but a judge ruled against it in September 2025. Swift and Lively are known to have had a close friendship and reference is made in the newly unsealed legal documents to the song “My Tears Ricochet” from Swift’s “Folklore” album being used in the “It Ends with Us” trailer. Lively directed the music video for Swift’s song “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)” and the actress and her husband Reynolds frequently socialized with the singer and her now fiancé, NFL player Travis Kelce, including attending his games playing for the Kansas City Chiefs. In November 2024,Reynolds confirmed that Swift is the godmother to his and Lively’s three young daughters— James, Inez and Betty. The couple also have a son, Olin, born in 2023. Swift was not the only one to allegedly complain about Baldoni, the newly unsealed documents show. The legal documents also included what are said to be messages from “It Ends with Us” actress Jenny Slate, who allegedly wrote in one that “this has been a really gross and disturbing shoot, and I’m one of many who feel this way,” about her time spent on set. CNN has reached out to representatives for Slate for comment.

"Remembering Catherine O’Hara, brilliant star of ‘Home Alone’ and ‘Schitt’s Creek’","Catherine O’Hara, the radiant actress whose singular comedic delivery helped elevate movies and TV shows like “Beetlejuice,” “Home Alone” and “Schitt’s Creek” to cult classic status, has died. She was 71. A statement from CAA, the agency that represented O’Hara, said the actress died Friday “at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness.” O’Hara got her start at Second City in her native Canada, before turning to film, where she brought to life two of cinema’s most memorable mothers. In 1988’s “Beetlejuice,” she played Delia Deetz, a devilish mom who made no secret of her love for “Prince Valium” and turnedlip syncinginto an art form. She reprised the role in 2024’s “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.” In 1990’s “Home Alone,” O’Hara turned a one-word movie line (“KEVIN!”) into pop culture history. As a frazzled mom of five who left one of her brood (Macaulay Culkin) at home during their holiday trip to France, O’Hara brought heart and humor to the nowclassic Christmas movie. A sequel was released in 1992. Just two years ago, O’Hara showed up to the Walk of Fame ceremony as her on-screen son Culkin received his star. “Thank you for including me, your fake mom who left you home alone not once, but twice, to share in this happy occasion,” O’Hara told him. “I’m so proud of you.” On Friday, Culkin paid tribute to O’Hara onsocial media, addressing her as “mama.” “I thought we had time,” he wrote. “I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you but I had so much more to say. I love you.” “Home Alone” director Chris Columbus said he was “stunned and heartbroken” by O’Hara’s passing and praised the “profound emotional depth” she brought to the movie. “What most people don’t realize is that Catherine carries the weight of 50% of that film. The movie simply would not work without her extraordinary performance,” he told CNN in a statement. He added: “I will miss her greatly. Yet there is a small sense of comfort, realizing that two of the finest human beings I’ve ever known, Catherine and John Candy, are together again, brilliantly improvising, making each other laugh.” Candy had a part in the movie, playing a traveling musician whose band helps O’Hara’s character get home to her child. After the success of “Home Alone,” she turned to collaborating with director Christopher Guest, starring in many of his iconic mockumentaries, including “Waiting for Guffman” (1996) and “Best in Show” (2000). “I am devastated,” Guest told CNN in a statement. “We have lost one of the comic giants of our age.” In those films, O’Hara worked often alongside Eugene Levy, becoming a signature duo who went on to co-star in the acclaimed series “Schitt’s Creek” together. As wayward posh actress Moira Rose, O’Hara’s one-liners were meme gold and earned her critical praise. O’Hara won an Emmy in 2020 during a Covid-era ceremony that saw stars masked up and celebrating while scattered across the globe, with the action captured on 130 dispatched cameras. In her speech, O’Hara thanked creators Eugene and Dan Levy for “bestowing me the opportunity to play a woman of a certain age, my age, who gets to fully be her ridiculous self.” On Friday evening, Dan Levy wrote on Instagram that O’Hara and his father spent over 50 years collaborating, so he counted her as “extended family before she ever played my family.” “It’s hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her,” he wrote. O’Hara also won a Golden Globe for her performance on the show in 2021. “Moira’s way more interesting than I am,” she once told the New York Times. “And the fun thing about her was that she was an actor, so I could, once in a while, get to perform or get to do an accent. Once you’ve had that in your life, it’s really hard to give up.” Most recently, O’Hara played a fallen executive in “The Studio,” for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. She also appeared in a critical role in Season 2 of HBO Max’s “The Last of Us,” for which she was also nominated for an Emmy. Star Pedro Pascal called O’Hara a “genius” on a tribute posted to his Instagram page. “There is less light in my world, this lucky world that had you, will keep you, always,” he wrote. O’Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch and sons Matthew and Luke. A private celebration of life will be held by the family, according to her agency.

"From ‘The Big Chill’ to ‘Inception,’ here are the 25 films added to the National Film Registry this year","While President Donald Trump is pushing Americans to see his wife’s documentary “Melania” which premieres this week, the Library of Congress is reminding us that the country’s cinematic history is vast and well worth celebrating. The body on Thursday released its annual list of films added to the National Film Registry “due to their cultural, historic or aesthetic importance to preserve the nation’s film heritage.” The Library named 25 films in total, dating from 1896 to 2014. The list includes classics from the ’80s and ’90’s, including “The Big Chill,” “The Karate Kid,” “Philadelphia” and “Before Sunrise,” as well as newer fare like “Inception” and “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” No one tell the president that the 1992 comedy “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,” in which he famously makes a cameo, did not make the cut. The Library of Congress National Film Registry was established by Congress when the National Film Preservation Act was passed in 1988. The selections for 2025 bring the number of titles in the registry to 925. Wes Anderson, who directed “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” said the Library of Congress inspired his film’s visual style. “When we were first starting to try to figure out, how do we tell this story… the architecture and the landscapes… they don’t exist anymore,”Anderson said in a statement to NPR.“We just went through the entire photocrom collection, which is a lot of images. And …we made our own versions of things, but much of what is in our film comes directly - with our little twist on it - from that collection, from the library, the Library of Congress.” Trump has targeted the Library of Congress in his desire to overhaul the government. In May 2025,he firedthe long-serving Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who still had about a year and a half left in her 10-year term. Later that year,the Supreme Court stopped Trump, at least temporarily, from replacing a top official at the Library of Congress, Shira Perlmutter, the director of the US Copyright Office. The films added by the Library of Congress to the National Film Registry for 2025 are:",2026-01-29T16:43:45.026Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/entertainment/library-congress-national-film-registry,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/msdphil-ec002.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:30:19
Bowen Yang describes what it was like exiting ‘Saturday Night Live’: ‘I stayed on exactly as long as I wanted to’,"If you thought Bowen Yang was overbeing emotional about leaving “Saturday Night Live,”you would be mistaken. The now former “SNL” cast member gave the exit interview we all definitely needed when he talked about his experienceon the latest episode of “Las Culturistas,”the podcast he co-hosts with his best friend Matt Rogers. Rogers began in the episode, titled “Exit Interview (The Cathartic Episode),” by joking that anyone who didn’t know that Yang had left the long-running NBC sketch show after seven and a half years must be living under “not even a rock, a boulder, a big rock.” Yang said it was “time,” and that prior to the pandemic and the “the current media landscape,” seven years was usually the time most cast members would head off for other pastures. “In a lot of cases (cast members) don’t have the like, privilege of staying on as long as they would like to,” he said. “I have this very beautiful thing where I get to say that I stayed on exactly as long as I wanted to.” “It’s like landing the Mars rover on like a square foot of terrain,” Yang said of his last “SNL” appearance on December 20, which saw him engaging in sketches with the evening’s host – and his “Wicked” costar – Ariana Grande, along with one final sketch that involved the night’s musical guest Cher. “It was like, there were no guarantees about how any of it was gonna shake out.” Listeners of the podcast also learned some life lessons via Yang on “SNL,” including that “working there is just making peace with the fact that like, things are completely out of your control. Down to the audience response to a joke,” he shared. “Nothing is guaranteed. Like that is sort of it in a nutshell,” Yang said. “It kind of is perfectly illustrative of what that job is. And it was resonant all the way through to the end. And I feel really – this word is meaningless I think maybe now – but so grateful.” Bowen Yang tearfully bids farewell to ‘Saturday Night Live’ with the help of Cher and Ariana Grande His cohost disagreed that it was meaningless, given that “there probably were so many times during that experience where you didn’t know if you were going to be able to end the experience of working there with gratitude.” “So many different people havemany different kinds of experiencesleaving that show,” Rogers added. “You come in and there is a shared experience of being at ‘SNL,’ but then ultimately it comes down to, there’s like a collectivism there, but there’s an individualism in terms of like, everyone is on their own journey there,” Yang agreed. “Everyone has a different length of their tenure, completely different struggles.” But there was clearly a lot of joy too, as Yang talked about the blessing of working on a show where one could go from having an idea early in the week and have it on the air that weekend. Plus the idea of not having to necessarily learn lines, as there were cue cards. All things he said were not transferable experiences to most other TV shows. Regarding the final sketch where he played a Delta One employee working his last shift, Yang said he cried during the table read the Wednesday prior and admitted that it was “completely self-indulgent” to be able to have the character say goodbye – something other former cast members didn’t get. He then got emotional recalling how people showed up for him during his final sketch, including his friend and former “SNL” co-cast member Aidy Bryant who left the show in 2022 after a decade, along with many who worked behind the scenes. “I get on the floor, I look out, and it was like basically everyone who worked there was off the floor showing up,” he said on the podcast, tearfully. “And I just looked out and I thought, I’m so lucky that I ever got to work here. And I’m so lucky that I get to make this little statement that’s barely veiled, where I’m like, ‘I love you all.’” Yang is not the only longtime cast member who has been reflecting on leaving the legendary show. Ego Nwodim also recently left after seven seasons, andlast weekend talked to E! on the Critics Choice Awardsred carpet about it. “I got to be part of such an incredible ensemble. I learned so much,” she said. “Then, I wanted to take those skills that I learned and cultivated there and see what else I can do.”",2026-01-08T20:31:00.694Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/entertainment/bowen-yang-exiting-snl,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2252354713.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:30:31

The first ‘Battle’ for award show domination is won and other takeaways from the 2026 Golden Globes,"Toward the end of the evening, Julia Roberts claimed it had been “a beautiful night to be an artist,” and that was very much the case – even if the reality of the outside world didn’t quite break into the room like it sometimes does. It was an unforgettable night for many, including 11 actors and one director who took home their very first Golden Globes, according to the organization. Let the battle to upset “One Battle After Another’s” award season momentum begin. The acclaimed film from director Paul Thomas Anderson scooped up four awards on Sunday, earning the award for best musical or comedy film, as well as a best supporting actress in a motion picture win for Teyana Taylor. Anderson also picked up two individual honors, one for best director and one for best screenplay. The Globe wins were the first for the “Phantom Thread” director, who was previously nominated for writing 2021’s “Licorice Pizza.” Anderson – an 11-time Academy Award-nominee – also directed awards darling “There Will Be Blood,” as well as acclaimed ’90s titles “Boogie Nights” and “Magnolia.” But could this year be his to finally pick up an Oscar? The signs are looking good so far. Not only do the four statues bode well for the film’s future, but the room buzzed with good will for Anderson, who didn’t try to hide his glee. While accepting the honor for best director, his second award of the evening, Anderson said, “You guys are being so generous with this affection for me and this film, and I’ll take it. I’ll take it with the love that it’s given and the appreciation.” “One Battle After Another” stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a washed up revolutionary who finds himself facing off against nefarious entities led by a frightening colonel (Sean Penn). Both DiCaprio and Penn were also nominated at the Globes this year, along with newcomer Chase Infiniti, who played DiCaprio’s on-screen daughter, and an uproarious Benicio del Toro in the role of a well-connected karate teacher. The film was also up for best original score. One question that seemed to dominate conversation on Sunday had nothing to do with the genre-scrambling film’s Oscar chances, but, rather, its categorization as a comedy in the first place, which is a whole other can of worms. Those who have seen “One Battle After Another” — an edge-of-your-seat thriller/political manifesto — probably wouldn’t immediately put it in a “comedy or musical” category, but the Globes gonna Globe. This year was no exception. This is, of course, a problem unique to this show as it makes a distinction between drama and comedy/musical categories – something that has long caused many to scratch heads, particularly among film honorees. Presenter Judd Apatow took a long moment on stage to talk about his “beef” with the Globes stemming from this very issue. In 2015, the Ridley Scott-directed sci-fi odyssey “The Martian” ended up in the best musical or comedy category and beat out Apatow’sactualcomedy “Trainwreck,” starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. “You know Ridley Scott – America’s favorite comedy director. Director of such hilarious comedies as ‘Gladiator,’ ‘Blade Runner’ and ‘Alien,’” Apatow joked on stage. The category confusion continued this year. Rose Byrne, who won in the best female actor for a musical or comedy category for the harrowing film “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” – a portrait of an extremely overextended mother brought to the brink – noted during her acceptance speech that she “didn’t sing” in the role. One thing the Globes can say: its polarizing box office achievement category – frustrating as some might find it that a Netflix movie with a limited theatrical run (“KPop Demon Hunters”) was nominated alongside a movie that earned the distinction before it even hit theaters (“Avatar: Fire and Ash”) – did work as intended, withbox office behemoth “Sinners”taking home the statue. So maybe there is –sometimes– a method to the madness. Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser’s monologue was as self aware as they come, with the night’s emcee joking that the show was “without a doubt the most important thing happening in the world right now.” And that’s about as political as the ceremony got for quite a while. Though some years past have been ripe with political commentary on stage, the topic was notably absent this year, with speech givers opting to shout-out their families and people inside the Globes ballroom as opposed to the weighty issues outside of it. The red carpet was a slightly different story. Several celebrities including Mark Ruffalo and Jean Smart wore “Be Good” pins in support of Renee Nicole Good, the Minnesota mother who wasshot and killed by ICE agentslast week. Smart, who won a Globe for best actress in a musical or comedy, later spoke toExtraabout her decision to make a political statement at an award show, saying that she understands why people may not always want to hear what celebrities have to say about what’s going on in the world. “I have mixed feelings about, you know, getting political or making social commentary at an awards event,” she said, later adding that she feels “we’ve gotten to a point now that is so important that everybody wakes up and opens their eyes, and is brave and calm, but at the same time try to be active.” “Go with your conscience and stay involved,” she said. “Adolescence” writer Jack Thorne also touched on social commentary during his acceptance speech, saying that “removing hate is our generation’s responsibility.” “It requires thought from the top down,” he added. “The possibility seems remote now, but hope is a beautiful thing.” And while presenting the award for best director, Apatow quipped that “we’re in a dictatorship now,” but immediately lightened the tone by joking that he was mostly focused on seeking justice for his film’s loss ten years ago. The evening on the TV side was largely predictable, with Noah Wyle winning best actor in a TV drama for “The Pitt” and Jean Smart winning the Globe for best actress in a TV comedy for “Hacks,” a role for which she also won in 2022 and 2025. One first-time winner did squeeze into the lineup, however: Rhea Seehorn, who took home her first-ever Globe for her performance in the Apple TV sci-fi drama “Pluribus,” a surprising moment in the night’s TV realm considering she went up against Hollywood vets including Kathy Bates and Helen Mirren. During her speech, she thanked “Pluribus” creator Vince Gilligan – who also created “Better Call Saul,” on which Seehorn starred – for “writing me the role of a lifetime.” As for other first-time winners, the night was kicked off on an emotional note thanks to “One Battle” standout Taylor, who won for her role as the fierce Perfidia Beverly Hills. In her teary acceptance speech, Taylor addressed her “brown sisters and (the) little brown girls watching tonight,” saying “our softness is not a liability.” “Our depth is not debt, it’s not too much,” she said. “Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space.” Other notable speeches included Timothée Chalamet’s, who last year openly admitted he wanted to be “one of the greats” while on an awards podium. When he again found himself in the limelight on Sunday after winning the award for best male actor in a musical or comedy for his role as a ping pong prodigy in “Marty Supreme,” he chose a somewhat humbler tone in his acceptance speech, sharing a life lesson that his father taught him. “My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up. Always be grateful for what you have. It’s allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty handed with my head held high, grateful just to be here,” Chalamet said. “I’d be lying if I didn’t say those moments didn’t make this moment that much sweeter.” Speaking of speeches, we heard several from the stars of “Adolescence” — three to be exact, after the series’ stars Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Dougherty all took home awards in their respective categories. It does at this point sort of feel like we’ve been watching these actors win awards for this show forever though, so it’s worth noting that tonight may be the night that concludes the “Adolescence” victory lap in the show’s hugely successful award circuit run. One person who me may see next year? Sophomore Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser, whose searing opening monologue had everyone from Leonardo DiCaprio to Julia Roberts taking jabs in stride.

There’s new ‘toxic mom group’ drama starring Ashley Tisdale and Hilary Duff’s husband,"Beef looks a little different these days for some former teen actors from the early 2000s. Along with the return of low rise jeans and trucker hats, the world can also now revel in what appears to be drama between two former Disney channel stars. It all publicly started whenThe Cut published a personal essay from actress Ashley Tisdalelast week titled “Breaking Up With My Toxic Mom Group.” The star, known for her work on “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody” and the “High School Musical” franchise, wrote about how she and some friends had formed a group chat to talk about being new moms, after all being “pregnant through the early pandemic” and missing out “on the activities where you meet other expectant mothers.” Through the chat and the playdates it spawned, Tisdale initially believed she had found her “village,” she wrote. At some point, she “began to wonder whether that was really true.” “I remember being left out of a couple of group hangs, and I knew about them because Instagram made sure it fed me every single photo and Instagram Story,” she wrote. “Another time, at one of the mom’s dinner parties, I realized where I sat with her — which was at the end of the table, far from the rest of the women. I was starting to feel frozen out of the group, noticing every way that they seemed to exclude me.” She recalled other times being left out and feeling distanced from the group, all of which made her wonder “Why me?” “The truth is, I don’t know and I probably never will. What I do know is that it took me back to an unpleasant but familiar feeling I thought I’d left behind years ago,” she wrote. “Here I was sitting alone one night after getting my daughter to bed, thinking,Maybe I’m not cool enough?All of a sudden, I was in high school again, feeling totally lost as to what I was doing ‘wrong’ to be left out.” Quicker than you could say “MomTok”(which has its own drama), internet sleuths quickly deduced by combing social media that said mom group included fellow actresses and child stars Hilary Duff and Mandy Mooreas well as some other high profile women living in Los Angeles. Then Duff’s husband, singer/songwriter Matthew Koma, metaphorically entered the chat. On Tuesday, Koma took to Instagram stories to post a photo of himself made to look like Tisdale’s photo in her Cut essay using the outlet’s logo and a fake headline reading “When You’re The Most Self Obsessed Tone Deaf Person On Earth, Other Moms Tend To Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.” He added a subheadline that read “A Mom Group Tell All Through A Father’s Eyes” and included as a caption “Read my new interview with @TheCut.” Duff, who starred in Disney Channel’s hit series “Lizzie McGuire” as a teen, married Koma, who is in the band Winnetka Bowling League, in 2019 and they are the parents of three young daughters. She also shares a son with her ex-husband Mike Comrie. Tisdale’s essay for The Cut is not her first on the subject to go viral. In December 2025,a post on her blog headlined “You’re Allowed to Leave Your Mom Group”under her married name, Ashley French, stirred conversation on social media. CNN has reached out to reps for Tisdale, Duff, Koma and Moore for comment.",2026-01-07T16:01:00.782Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/07/entertainment/ashley-tisdale-hilary-duff-husband-toxic-mom-group,Lisa Respers France,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20260107-tisdale.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:31:07
"2026 Movie Preview: Get ready for superheroes, sequels… and an epic ‘Odyssey’","Theever-endangered movie theateris making another strong bid for your IRL attendance in 2026. Many of the year’s most anticipated films are, unsurprisingly, sequels or updates to prior beloved material, with a few breaths of fresh air in the mix for good measure. Here’s a taste of what our collective cinematic future holds: Ralph Fiennes’ surprisingly genteel post-apocalyptic doctor returns in this fourth “28 Days Later” installment, conceivably picking up shortly after the rather bonkers ending of last year’s “28 Years Later.” Expect more naked zombies. If the excessive strobe lights in the trailer haven’t put you off, this (we think) concert mockumentary covering Charli XCX’s “brat” tour might finally be the movie worthy of following in the footsteps of Madonna’s “Truth or Dare.” From Emerald Fennell, the director of “Promising Young Woman,” this Emily Brontë adaptation out just in time for Valentine’s Day bursts its bodice in the trailer alone, featuring smoldering, scandalous looks shared between Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. Co-produced by basketball great Stephen Curry, this animated underdog movie introduces us to Will Harris (voiced by“Stranger Things” starCaleb McLaughlin), a goat hoping to become a GOAT in the sport of roarball. “White Lotus”Season 3 MVP Sam Rockwelltakes us on a madcap journey into a terrifying future that seemingly starts at famed Los Angeles diner chain Norms, where he goes looking for people to help him save the world. Costars include fellow “White Lotus” alum Haley Lu Richardson, and Zazie Beetz. Maggie Gyllenhaal directs “Hamnet” star Jessie Buckley as the Bride of Frankenstein and Christian Bale as Frankenstein’s monster in a film that looks like it’s as far away from the classic Universal monster movies from days of yore as possible. Look for Maggie’s brother (and “Donnie Darko” costar) Jake Gyllenhaal in an as-yet-unspecified role. After last year’s much-talked-about “It Ends With Us,” the next Colleen Hoover novel to get the movie adaptation treatment tells the story of a woman (“It Follows” star Maika Monroe) searching for redemption after a prison sentence. “Gilmore Girls” alum Lauren Graham, “The Handmaid’s Tale” actor Bradley Whitford, and Tyriq Withers of “Him” fame all co-star. From “The Martian” writer Andy Weir comes a newsci-fi epic, this one based on his 2021 novel about a science teacher (Ryan Gosling) who wakes up on a spaceship to find himself in an unbelievable predicament. Zendaya and Robert Pattinson star as a soon-to-be-wed couple who encounter copious amounts of the title subject in this different looking rom-com. Following the massive success of 2023’s first film, Chris Pratt is back as Mario for a new adventure alongside Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser and more, including new cast addition Brie Larson as the voice of Rosalina. Let’s-a go! “The Little Mermaid’s” Halle Bailey and “Bridgerton” star Regé-Jean Page team up for this spicy-looking rom-com that feels like an “Under the Tuscan Sun” for the youngsters. The Michael Jackson biopic from Antoine Fuqua of “Training Day” fame follows the King of Pop’s rise to the top, and stars Jackson’s nephew Jaafar Jackson in the title role. This one is sure to be a talker for several reasons, not the least of which being that the film’s productionreportedly ran into a major roadblockwith the script that delayed the film’s release. Time is moving at a glacial pace as fans of the 2006 filmawait this sequel. Returning cast members including Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are joined by franchise newcomers Justin Theroux, Kenneth Branagh and Lady Gaga. This new entry in the storied universe will welcome sci-fi queen Sigourney Weaver to the franchise. She plays a colonel who sends the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and Grogu – formerly known as the Child orBaby Yoda– on a new mission to the Outer Rim. A Steven Spielberg alien extravaganza released in summer? Pinch me! This one, starring Emily Blunt, is Spielberg’s first feature since 2022’s “Fabelmans” and his first sci-fi-leaning movie since “Ready Player One” in 2018. Is the age of toys really over? That isthe fateful questionseemingly posed by this new Pixar installment, which picks up on the familiar parenting conundrum about screentime as Woody, Buzz and the gang encounter a new doohickey in the playroom – a tablet. Milly Alcock stars as the Man of Steel’s cousin, an unruly intergalactic renegade (and actual owner of Krypto the Superdog, as seen in her“Superman” cameo). Directed by Christopher Nolan, this epic based on the monumental poem by Homer is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, with a cast of truly mythic proportions: Matt Damon, Anne Hathaway, Charlize Theron, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Robert Pattinson, Elliot Page and Lupita Nyong’o costar. Speaking of Tom Holland and Zendaya, two weeks after they embark on their odyssey, they return for a fourth go-round in Marvel’s Spider-Man franchise, seemingly setting the scene for “Doomsday,” out later in the year. Let the sequel festivities continuewith this updateto the beloved 1998 witch movie starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman as sisters who each take a very different approach to their familial gifts. Dianne West and Stockard Channing are back as their meddling aunts Jet and Franny, respectively, with Lee Pace and “Game of Thrones” star Maisie Williams joining the fun. Tom Cruise teams with “Revenant” and “Birdman” director Alejandro G. Iñárritu for this dark comedy following the most powerful man in the world, who has some truly destructive tricks up his sleeve. Directed by Aaron Sorkin – who wrote and won an Oscar forthe script for 2010’s groundbreaking David Fincher movie “The Social Network” – this followup takes another look at the society-shaping social media platform, this time with “Succession” and “Apprentice” star Jeremy Strong in the role of Mark Zuckerberg. Also starring last year’s best actress Oscar-winnerMikey Madison. Thisnew installmentin the film franchise based on the bestselling YA book series by Suzanne Collins again dials things back, this time looking at Haymitch Abernathy’s origins. Haymitch, portrayed as a middle-age adult in earlier films by Woody Harrelson, will be portrayed in this prequel by newcomer Joseph Zada. Jennifer Lawrence is expected to (at least briefly) reprise her role as Katniss Everdeen. Just in time for Thanksgiving, more awkward family shenanigans will ensue when the son (Skyler Gisondo) of Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam Focker (Teri Polo) brings home his fiancée (Ariana Grande) to, well, meet the parents. Santa (“Stranger Things” actor David Harbour) is back for more bloody holiday fun in “Violent Night 2,” a follow-up to the 2022 original. If theabsolutely stacked castof this MCU mashup of the X-Men and Avengers didn’t feel quite stacked enough,Disney recently revealedvia a new teaser that the movie will also feature the return of Chris Evans as Captain America. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya (who is particularly busy this year, as seen above) return for the next installment of this epic science fiction franchise, directed by Denis Villeneuve, based on the Frank Herbert book series. Like 2024’s “Nosferatu,” director Robert Eggers will be bringing us a peculiar Christmas gift with his new take on the classic werewolf story.

Pictures, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros.

Noah Wyle promised Season 2 of ‘The Pitt’ was going to get ‘complicated.’ He wasn’t exaggerating,"Season 2 of “The Pitt” has officially begun, showcasing another 15-hour day in the life of the emergency department staff at Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. The premiere was as chaotic as we’ve come to expect from the Emmy-winning series. This season centers on belovedDr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch(Noah Wyle) clocking in for his last shift before taking a three-month sabbatical and the return of Dr. Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball) after he’s spent some time in a rehab center the drug addiction. It all takes place on the backdrop of the 4th of July, a notoriously grisly holiday in emergency rooms across the country. “We wanted to have a busy shift,” Wyle told CNN recently. “We wanted to have a holiday weekend. We wanted to explore all the different ways Americans can hurt themselves while they celebrate their independence.” Wyle promised that with these dynamics at play, the new season was going to be as “complicated” as ever. And it delivered. The premiere picked up 10 months after the events of Season 1, during which a mass casualty event unfolded in the final episodes. Dr. Robby started his day by training his replacement – a new by-the-book attending named Dr. Baran Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi), who wastes no time telling him that she wants to launch a campaign “to eradicate” referring to the emergency department as “the Pitt.” Dr. Al-Hashimi comes from a hospital that does not typically handle trauma cases and tries to put in place new protocols that Dr. Robby bristles at, clearly bothered by how quickly they’re being implemented. The two are seen trying to navigate different leadership styles, down to where they’re supposed to stand. It was awkward and clearly it is going to be a long 15 hours for them both. The episode ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, with Dr. Al-Hashimi freezing up after receiving updated medical information about an infant that she was treating with Dr. Mohan (Supriya Ganesh). Elsewhere, Dr. Langdon’s first day back was emotionally loaded. His colleagues were largely welcoming, but his presence earned him an uncomfortable glance from Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones), who last season sounded the alarm to hospital leadership about his addiction. There were other storylines teed up in the premiere, like Dr. Santos taking on a potential child abuse case and Dr. Melissa “Mel” King (Taylor Deardon) stressed out over a lawsuit. Wyle – who also serves as a writer, director and an executive producer on the series – said it was important for the show to address all aspects of the healthcare system this season. “I feel an incredible responsibility,” he said. “Not only to depicting what the healthcare system looks like to its minutiae but also the emotional toll that it takes on the practitioners and the providers who work within it.” New episodes of “The Pitt” are released weekly on Thursdays on HBO Max, which shares a parent company with CNN.",2026-01-09T14:01:11.983Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/09/entertainment/the-pitt-season-2-noah-wyle,Alli Rosenbloom,entertainment,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/noah-wyle-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:31:32
