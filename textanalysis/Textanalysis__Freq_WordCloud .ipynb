              "[' (CNN)Right now, there\\'s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world\\'s largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen\\'s trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we\\'re testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn\\'t touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple\\'s president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn\\'t need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple\\'s trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won\\'t be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company\\'s own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple\\'s trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation\\'s trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that\\'s still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you\\'re adding five cents per mile. But you\\'re saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic \\'Ironhand\\' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn\\'t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that\\'s not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple\\'s autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that\\'s a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it\\'s more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don\\'t want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They\\'re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn\\'t get tired, doesn\\'t watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn\\'t get distracted.\" ',\n",

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around ??,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer\\'s risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers.

He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it\\'s not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.',\n",

              " 'New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world\\'s most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it\\'s not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it\\'s still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don\\'t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It\\'s always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They\\'re not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS ??and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it\\'s a moot point. But it\\'s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe ??think Poland ?? is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine.

The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia\\'s oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin\\'s military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect.

As a result, Moscow will repay creditors from \"countries that are unfriendly\" in rubles until the sanctions are lifted, he said.Credit ratings agencies would likely consider Russia to be in default if Moscow misses payments or repays debt issued in dollars or euros with other currencies such as the ruble or China\\'s yuan. A default could drive the few remaining foreign investors out of Russia and further isolate the country\\'s crumbling economy. The default could come as early as Wednesday, when Moscow needs to hand over $117 million in interest payments on dollar-denominated government bonds, according to JPMorgan Chase. Although Russia has issued bonds that can be repaid in multiple currencies since 2018, these payments must be made in US dollars.Imminent defaultRead MoreKristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Sunday that a Russian default is no longer \"improbable.\"\"Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it,\" she said during an interview on CBS\\' Face the Nation.Last week, Fitch Ratings downgraded Russian debt, saying Moscow\\'s willingness and ability to service its debts has been undermined and default \"is imminent.\" The ratings agency also warned that Russia may attempt to repay creditors in specified countries in rubles.Analysts at Capital Economics said that a default was already reflected in the price of Russia\\'s dollar bonds, which have crashed to trade at just 20 cents on the dollar.The interest payments due Wednesday come with a 30-day grace period. But credit ratings agencies could declare Russia to be in default before that period ends if Moscow makes clear that it does not intend to pay.Russia last defaulted on its domestic debt when the country was plunged into a financial crisis by a collapse in commodity prices in 1998. Its most recent foreign currency default came in 1918 when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government.What happens nextThe Russian government has borrowed relatively little. JPMorgan estimates that it had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors.But the potential consequences of a default are difficult to gauge. The 2008 global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic showed how negative shocks can spread across the modern interconnected global financial system and economy. International banks are owed more than $121 billion by Russian entities, according to the Bank for International Settlements. European banks have over $84 billion total claims, with France, Italy and Austria the most exposed, and US banks owed $14.7 billion.Georgieva said Sunday that a financial crisis was unlikely to develop \"for now,\" saying that the exposure of Western banks was \"not systemically relevant.\"Even if Moscow halts payments to foreign investors on all sovereign debt, the roughly $60 billion default ??including ruble debt held overseas ??would be in the same ballpark as Argentina\\'s in 2020 ??a non-event for markets.But analysts at Capital Economics warned that one major financial institution might be particularly exposed to Russian debt, which could cause broader financial contagion. A second risk is that a default could trigger missed payments by Russian companies.Vladimir Potanin, Russia\\'s richest businessman, called last week for Moscow to ease restrictions on foreign currency so that interest could be paid on foreign bonds and loans. Otherwise, there was a risk the country could default on its entire external debt, which he estimated at about $480 billion.\"For Russia, the main cost is being locked out of global capital markets, or at least higher borrowing costs for a prolonged period. But sanctions have done that anyway,\" wrote analysts at Capital Economics.',\n",
              " 'New York (CNN Business)US oil prices briefly tumbled below $100 a barrel on Monday, unwinding a significant chunk of the recent spike caused by Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.Oil plunged more than 8%, touching a low of $99.76 a barrel. That means oil has lost almost roughly quarter of its value since touching a near 14-year high of $130.50 a barrel on March 6. It\\'s the first time oil has traded below $100 since March 1.\"This is one hell of a correction,\" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Analysis.The selloff should ease fears of an energy-driven recession in the United States and, if sustained, should bring some relief to drivers dealing with record gasoline prices. Read MoreBrent crude, the world benchmark, dropped more than 7% to $104.35 a barrel in recent trading. That marks a sharp pullback from the recent peak of nearly $140 a barrel.Uber is rolling out a fuel surchargeTraders blamed Monday\\'s losses on concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns in China and hopes for progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.\"You\\'re seeing some vicious selling,\" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst of the Americas at Kpler.Despite the recent selling, oil remains up by more than 30% on the year.What this means for gas pricesStill, the tumble back to $100 should cool off prices at the pump, which move with a lag to oil. If oil prices stay at current levels, the national average price for regular gasoline would likely dip by about 20 cents a gallon, Kloza said. That would mean gas prices are still high ??and above $4 a gallon nationally ??but below record highs.Gas prices have already stopped going straight up, even before Monday\\'s sharp decline in oil. According to AAA, the national average stands at $4.33 a gallon on Monday. That\\'s unchanged from Friday, so things seem to be leveling out ??albeit basically at record highs.Why are US gas prices soaring when America barely uses Russian oil?Unfortunately, any relief at the pump may not last long.Kloza still expects gasoline prices to rise this spring and summer as demand recovers, with the national average climbing to around $4.50 a gallon. \"It\\'s just going to be a wild ride,\" Kloza said.Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank, similarly believes oil prices have not yet set their highest levels of the current cycle. \"Ultimately, we\\'ll see new highs before all is said and done,\" said Fitzmaurice. \"Given how big and important Russia is, we will probably breach those all-time highs set in 2008.\"Covid lockdowns in ChinaThe latest leg of the oil selloff came after China locked down Shenzhen, a major technology hub, as well as several other regions to contain its worst Covid-19 outbreak in two years. The lockdowns in China, which has a zero-tolerance Covid policy, raised fears in the energy market about slower demand from the world\\'s No. 2 economy.\"Coronavirus has taught us you cannot count on a stable outcome,\" said Kloza. \"Just when you think people are going back to normal behavior, here it comes.\"Oil traders are also watching for developments in the war in Ukraine, including continued negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. A ceasefire could ease fears about a prolonged disruption in oil flows from Russia, the No. 2 oil producer in the world last year. However, energy veterans cautioned against reading too much into the headlines around negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.\"I am super skeptical about any kind of negotiations having success here, period,\" said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities. Yawger said even if a ceasefire were to emerge, the West is very unlikely to swiftly remove sanctions on Russia: \"Sanctions are not going to disappear anytime soon.\"',\n",
              " 'New DelhiIndia may take up a Russian offer to buy crude oil and other commodities at a discount, two Indian officials said, in a sign that Delhi wants to keep its key trading partner on board despite Western attempts to isolate Moscow through sanctions.U.S. officials have said in recent weeks they would like India to distance itself from Russia as much as possible, while recognizing its heavy reliance on Moscow for everything from arms and ammunition to missiles and fighter jets. India has not condemned the invasion of Ukraine and abstained from voting at the United Nations calling out Russia\\'s aggression. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\" to demilitarize and \"denazify\" the country.One person within India\\'s security apparatus said the West understood India\\'s position, given that it needs to keep its armed forces well supplied amid simmering territorial disputes with China.India, which imports 80% of its oil needs, usually buys only about 2% to 3% from Russia. But with oil prices up 40% so far this year, the government is looking at increasing this if it can help reduce its rising energy bill.Read More\"Russia is offering oil and other commodities at a heavy discount. We will be happy to take that,\" one of the Indian government officials said.Russia could default on its debt within daysThe official added that such trade required preparatory work including transportation, insurance cover and getting the right blend of crude, but once that was done India would take Russia up on its offer.The officials, who declined to be identified, did not say how much oil was on offer or what the discount was.The finance ministry did not reply to an email seeking comment.Reuters has reported that Indian officials are trying to set up a rupee-ruble mechanism with Russia to continue bilateral trade. Russia has urged what it describes as friendly nations to maintain trade and investment ties.Apart from oil, India is also looking for cheaper fertilizer from Russia and its ally Belarus, according to one of the officials.\\'Complicated history\\'Indian officials said they could not suddenly replace Russia with other suppliers, particularly in the defense sector.India\\'s dependence on Russia for its military hardware still runs as high as 60%, despite a significant reduction over the last decade.U.S. officials have declined to say if India would be sanctioned should Russia send S-400 missile systems as part of a $5.5 billion deal signed in 2018 for five of them.Initial supplies of the system started late last year despite a U.S. law aimed at deterring countries from buying Russian military hardware.Ely Ratner, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, told a U.S. Congress hearing last week that India was diversifying its defense suppliers.\"We recognize that India has a complicated history and relationship with Russia. The majority of the weapons that they buy are from the Russians,\" he said.\"The good news is that they are in a multi-year process of diversifying their arms purchases away from Russia -- that\\'s going to take some time. But they are clearly committed to doing that, including the indigenization of their own defense industry and that\\'s something we should support.\"British Foreign Minister Liz Truss also said last week that London should pursue closer economic and defense ties with India to help it reduce its reliance on Russia.Since 2011, New Delhi has cut its defense imports from Russia by 53%.D.

              " 'New York (CNNBusiness)As Russia\\'s assault in Ukraine intensifies, fear of radioactive fallout from accidental or intentional attacks on Ukraine\\'s nuclear plants, or from the use of a nuclear bomb, has triggered surging demand for potassium iodide pills.In such an event, there\\'s the frightening risk of large amounts of radioactive iodine (or radioiodine) being released into the atmosphere which can be breathed into lungs as well as contaminate water, soil, plants and animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Although potassium iodide itself isn\\'t harmful and is an important chemical that\\'s needed by the human body, the CDC says radioactive iodide can harm the thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck that produces many of the hormones that regulate the body. The danger is that if radiation exposure occurs, the thyroid gland can\\'t distinguish between regular iodine and radioiodine and will absorb both. Too much exposure can lead to thyroid cancer. When used as directed, potassium iodide in liquid or pill form can quickly saturate the thyroid gland and prevent it from absorbing radioactive iodine. Read MorePrice gouging sets in Large manufacturers of potassium iodide approved for sale in the United Sates have seen their inventories rapidly depleted in recent weeks, coinciding with Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.As supplies in the market dry up, price gouging has set in.On eBay (EBAY), four boxes of Thyrosafe potassium iodide tablets were listed for $132.50 on Monday. Another listing for a box of IOSAT 130 mg pills was selling for $89.95 each. The 14-pack box of the IOSAT tablets, made by Anbex, sell for $13.99 on the manufacturer\\'s website.Anbex is hoping to restock its inventory of IOSAT potassium Iodide tablets in the coming weeks.It\\'s also important to know that potassium iodide pills aren\\'t a cure-all and don\\'t offer 100% protection against radioactive iodine. The CDC warns that a single dose protects the thyroid gland for just 24 hours.The agency said taking a higher dose, or taking it more often than recommended, does not offer more protection and can cause severe illness or death.The CDC also cautions that potassium iodide pills only protect the thyroid and work best for certain age groups.Out of stockAnbex, Inc., based in New York, is a leading supplier and produces 65 mg and 130 mg IOSAT potassium iodide tablets. Its website currently shows a message saying, \"We are currently out of stock of IOSAT potassium iodide 130mg and 65mg tablets.\"\"We hope to be back in stock in early April but we\\'re pushing for late March,\" said Troy Jones, vice president of sales and marketing for Anbex. Jones also runs a website www.nukepills.com that sells Anbex\\'s potassium iodide pills.Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctionsJones said the company saw a rush of orders beginning in mid February of up to 15 million tablets from a variety of buyers, including individuals, resellers, hospitals, municipalities and governments worldwide.\"The big run started on February 23 through February 28. We sold out of all the inventory we had,\" Jones said. Although supplies are being replenished weekly, they\\'re selling out just as fast. \"In the past five days we\\'ve probably sold as much as what typically would take us half a year to sell,\" he added.The timeline, Jones said, matched reports last month that Russian forces had seized control of Ukraine\\'s Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The plant\\'s electrical system was reportedly damaged during the attack and required repair work.Russia could default on its debt within daysHistorically, demand for potassium iodide spikes when there\\'s a real or perceived threat of nuclear fallout, Jones said.Demand soared when former President Donald Trump tweeted in 2018 that he had a \"much bigger & more powerful\" button than North Korea\\'s Kim Jong-un, igniting fear about an escalating threat of nuclear war. It also happened in the same year when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency sent out a false ballistic missile alert.And just last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin said he had ordered his country\\'s deterrence forces ??which include nuclear arms ??to be at their highest state of alert. The White House responded to the move, calling it part of a wider pattern of unprovoked escalations and \"manufactured threats\" from the Kremlin. The escalating rhetoric from Russia only helped fuel anxiety ??and the purchase of potassium iodide, manufacturers said.Anbex, which sells its tablets in a 14- day or 20-day foil-sealed pack depending on the dosage, has ramped up production, said Jones. He said consumers should follow the CDC\\'s guidelines and only take potassium iodide pills on the advice of health officials.BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said demand for its Thyrosafe pills took off in February coinciding with Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.London-based BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said it\\'s also experiencing heightened demand for the company\\'s potassium iodide products across Europe and the US.  \"This has coincided with the conflict in Ukraine,\" said Chris Sampson, spokesperson for London-based BTG, which also has US operations. BTG makes Thyrosafe, an FDA-appoved 65 mg over-the-counter potassium iodide tablet. A box of 20 tablets is priced at $12.95 on the company\\'s website.Sampson said BTG has not been entirely out of stock, \"though we have temporarily stopped accepting orders through our own website and some of our partners/distributors have been out of stock.\"\"Most of our product is sold to governments, public health agencies and the military who manage stockpiles,\" he said. \"All of those orders are being met.\" The White House could not immediately be reached for comment on this story.-- CNN\\'s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report',\n",
              " ' (CNN Business)A digital Iron Curtain may be descending on Russia, as President Vladimir Putin struggles to control the narrative about his war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has already moved to block Facebook and Twitter, and its latest step in that direction came Friday as the government announced plans to block Instagram in the country, as well. But despite Putin\\'s efforts to clamp down on social media and information within his borders, a growing number of Russian internet users appear determined to access outside sources and circumvent the Kremlin\\'s restrictions.  To defeat Russia\\'s internet censorship, many are turning to specialized circumvention technology that\\'s been widely used in other countries with restricted online freedoms, including China and Iran. Digital rights experts say Putin may have inadvertently sparked a massive, permanent shift in digital literacy in Russia that will work against the regime for years. Since the invasion of Ukraine, Russians have been flocking to virtual private networks (VPNs) and encrypted messaging apps, tools that can be used to access blocked websites such as Facebook or safely share news about the war in Ukraine without running afoul of new, draconian laws banning what Russian authorities consider to be \"fake\" claims about the conflict.  A rapid rise in downloads Read MoreDuring the week of February 28, Russian internet users downloaded the five leading VPN apps on Apple and Google\\'s app stores a total of 2.7 million times, a nearly three-fold increase in demand compared to the week before, according to the market research firm SensorTower.  That growth dovetails with what some VPN providers have reported. Switzerland-based Proton, for example, told CNN Business it has seen a 1,000% spike in signups from Russia this month. (The company declined to provide a baseline figure for comparison, however.)  VPN providers are just one type of application seeing higher uptake in Russia. Since March 1, a range of messaging apps including Meta\\'s Messenger and WhatsApp services have seen a gradual increase in traffic, said the internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, a trend consistent with an increase in traffic to global social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.  But perhaps the fastest-growing messaging app in Russia may be the encrypted messaging app Signal. SensorTower said Signal was downloaded 132,000 times in the country last week, an increase of more than 28% from the week before. Russian internet traffic to Signal has seen \"significant growth\" since March 1, Cloudflare told CNN Business. Other private messaging apps, such as Telegram, saw a relative slowdown in growth that week but still witnessed more than half a million downloads in that timeframe, SensorTower said. In recent weeks, Russian internet users also appear to have increased their reliance on Tor, a service that anonymizes internet browsing by scrambling a user\\'s traffic and bouncing it through multiple servers around the world. Beginning the day of the Ukraine invasion, Tor\\'s metrics page estimated that thousands more Russian users were accessing the web through secret servers connected to Tor\\'s decentralized network. Tor users got a helping hand from Twitter on Tuesday, as the social network ??which has been partially blocked in Russia following the invasion ??added the ability to access its platform through a specialized website designed for Tor users. Facebook, for its part, has had its own Tor site since 2014.  And Lantern, a peer-to-peer tool that routes internet traffic around government firewalls, began seeing more downloads from Russia starting about two months ago, said Sascha Meinrath, a communications professor at Penn State University who sits on the board of Lantern\\'s parent company, Brave New Software.  Lantern has seen a 2,000% increase in downloads from Russia alone over the past two months, Meinrath said, with the service going from 5,000 monthly users in Russia to more than 120,000. By comparison, Meinrath said, Lantern has between 2 million and 3 million users globally, mostly in China and Iran. \"Tor, Lantern, all the VPNs, anything that\\'s masking who you are or where you\\'re going ?봗elegram ??everything, downloads are increasing dramatically,\" said Meinrath. \"And it\\'s a bootstrapping thing, so the people that are on Telegram, they\\'re using that to swap notes about what else you should download.\" The most tech-savvy and privacy-conscious users, said Meinrath, know how to combine multiple tools together to maximize their protection ??for example, by using Lantern to get around government blocks while also using Tor to anonymize their activity.  The war for information technology The growing prominence of some of these tools highlights the stakes for Russian internet users as the Kremlin has detained thousands of people for protesting the war in Ukraine. And it contrasts with the steps Russia has taken to clamp down on social media, from blocking Facebook entirely to passing a law that threatens up to 15 years behind bars for those who share what the Kremlin deems \"fake\" information about the war.  Natalia Krapiva, a lawyer at the digital rights group Access Now, said some Russian internet users have been using secure communications tools for years, as the Russian government began restricting internet freedoms more than a decade ago.  In the past, the Russian government has tried to block Tor and VPN providers, Krapiva said. But it hasn\\'t been very successful, she said, due to Tor\\'s open, decentralized design that hinges on many distributed servers and the willingness of new VPN providers to fill the gap left behind by banned ones. What Russia faces now is an intensifying game of cat and mouse, Krapiva said.  But while Putin may not be able to shut down censorship-resistant technologies entirely, supporters of the Kremlin can still try to drag it into Russia\\'s wider information war and hinder adoption.  On February. 28, Signal said it was aware of rumors suggesting the platform had been compromised in a hack ??a claim the company flatly denied. Without blaming Russia directly, Signal said it suspected the rumors were being spread as \"part of a coordinated misinformation campaign meant to encourage people to use less secure alternatives.\" Signal\\'s claim underscores how quickly the information war has evolved from being about the news coming out of Ukraine to being about the services people use to access and discuss that news. If only a small minority of Russians end up embracing circumvention technologies to get access to outside information, it may allow Putin to dominate the information space within the country. And while there are many indications of growing interest in these tools, it appears to be on the scale of thousands, not millions, at least for now.  \"The concern, of course, is that the majority of the people, the general population, might not necessarily know about those tools,\" said Krapiva. \"[They] can be complex if your digital literacy is quite low, so it\\'s going to remain a challenge to have a bigger section of the population really adopt these tools. But I\\'m sure there will be more education and I want to remain hopeful they will persevere.\" Normalizing censorship-resistant tech  Some digital rights experts say it\\'s important for these tools to be used for ordinary and innocuous internet activities, too, not just potentially subversive ones. Performing mundane tasks like checking email, accessing streaming movies or talking to friends using these technologies makes it harder for authoritarian regimes to justify cracking down on them, and can make it more difficult to identify efforts to violate government restrictions on speech and access. \"The more that regular users use censorship-resistant technology for everyday activities like unblocking movies, the better,\" said John Scott-Railton, a security and disinformation researcher at The University of Toronto\\'s Citizen Lab. And this may only be the start. Meinrath said the government restrictions will likely trigger not just broader adoption of circumvention tools in Russia but also further research and development of new tools by Russia\\'s highly skilled and tech-savvy population.  \"We\\'re at the beginning of a J-curve,\" Meinrath said, adding: \"This is a one-way transformation in Russia.\"  ',\n",

              " ' (CNN Business)Big tech platforms have joined the global backlash against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, with Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR), Spotify (SPOT), Netflix (NFLX) and others placing at least partial restrictions on Russian content ??if not exiting (or getting themselves blocked) altogether. In the past week, however, the severing of Russia from the global internet went one layer deeper. Two of the world\\'s largest internet service providers, Lumen Technologies and Cogent Communications, said they would block Russian customers from their networks over fears that their networks could be used by the Russian government for cyberattacks against the West. But a knock-on effect is that it will be even harder for citizens in the country to use the worldwide web. The move highlights the tension over Russia\\'s effort to erect what\\'s being called a digital Iron Curtain to close its citizens off from outside information, much like China has done for years. Companies find themselves caught between helping Russians freely access the internet and ensuring their services are not used by the Russian government to spread disinformation, propaganda or worse. The implications are massive. Lumen and Cogent collectively preside over nearly 600,000 miles of optical fiber that forms the piping for the global internet, with each boasting operations in more than 50 countries, according to their websites.Fear of cyberattacksRead MoreBoth companies insist their moves were squarely directed at the Russian government and not the Russian people, and any impediment to the latter\\'s ability to access outside information is an unfortunate side effect. \"We as a company are a very strong believer in an open and uncensored internet,\" Dave Schaeffer, Cogent\\'s CEO, said in an interview with CNN Business. \"This was a very difficult decision.\" Cogent Communications CEO Dave SchaefferAccording to Schaeffer, cutting Russia off is a preventative measure against cyberattacks that may be perpetrated through Cogent\\'s network by the Russian government or individuals linked to it. The company, which is based in Washington D.C., has limited its action to around 25 customers that are incorporated in Russia and are directly on Russian networks, he said. That means Russian businesses that use Cogent\\'s network outside the country through non-Russian state entities can continue to do so.\"We felt that the downside of having the possibility that these connections could be used offensively outweighed the negative of terminating some services,\" he added.An unprecedented decisionLumen, headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, cited similar reasoning for its decision, which came a few days after Cogent\\'s. \"We decided to disconnect the network due to increased security risk inside Russia,\" Mark Molzen, the company\\'s global issues director, said in an email. \"We have not yet experienced network disruptions but given the increasingly uncertain environment and the heightened risk of state action, we took this move to ensure the security of our and our customers\\' networks, as well as the ongoing integrity of the global Internet.\"The digital Iron Curtain: How Russia\\'s internet could soon start to look a lot like China\\'sIt\\'s also an unprecedented decision in some ways. Schaeffer said Cogent has previously taken down certain websites and addresses at the requests of governments in several countries, including Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States, as long as the requests have a lawful basis. \"This is different,\" he said, describing it as the first time the company has made a proactive move. \"We don\\'t look inside of our customers\\' pipes, what they do with them is their business. In this case, we terminated the entire pipe.\" Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the location of Lumen Technologies\\' headquarters. The company is headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana.',\n",
              " 'London (CNN Business)Nazmin Begum has a problem: she\\'s having to pay much more to keep her two children warm and fed as the United Kingdom endures its worst cost of living crisis in three decades.\"Everything\\'s increasing,\" she told CNN Business during a visit to The Boiler House, which provides discounted food, footwear and fuel vouchers from a red brick building on a public housing estate in east London. Begum\\'s energy bills for her one-bedroom apartment have shot up by about 짙70 ($92) in the past three months, even though she\\'s using similar amounts of fuel. She works at Tesco (TSCDF), a supermarket chain, where she has seen \"every single product\" rise in price.\"Milk was 80p ($1.05). The smallest one, that\\'s gone to 짙1 ($1.31),\" she said. \"The bread ??the cheapest bread that we used to do for 짙1 ??has gone to 짙1.20 ($1.57).\" Annual consumer price inflation hit 5.5% in January in the United Kingdom ??its highest level since 1992 ??fueled by product shortages and a sharp spike in demand as pandemic lockdowns were lifted. Wages aren\\'t keeping pace.  Read MoreAverage worker pay suffered its biggest drop in more than seven years in the three months to January, falling by 1% over the same period a year ago once inflation is taken into account, the UK Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. And the war in Ukraine has driven energy costs even higher ?? gasoline and diesel prices have soared to new record highs in recent days.The Boiler House has multiple sites, including the Northwold Youth & Community Hub in east London.The Boiler House Youth and Community Space started its food pantry during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike a traditional food bank, guests browse and shop for their own items, paying a 짙6.50 ($8.50) fee to receive about 짙35 ($46) worth of food and toiletries. But the charity\\'s services have expanded to provide members with shoes and help paying their energy bills as many struggle with  the most severe knock to their purchasing power in years. Davina Mathurin, project officer for The Boiler House, summarized the dilemma many are facing. \"Do you either keep the house warm so [your] children don\\'t get ill?\" she said. \"Or do [you] buy food so they can eat and they\\'re not hungry?\"Millions of people\\'s fuel bills rose in October when Britain\\'s energy regulator increased its consumer price cap ??the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy ??by 12% after a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels.A shopper carries his purchases in Walthamstow, east London, on February 13.On the day CNN Business visited in February, Mathurin had started referring some members to fuel voucher programs organized by charities that offer up to 짙49 ($64) to help with bills. Demand was high, she said.  Monique John, another regular visitor to the Boiler House, told CNN Business that she owns a smart meter. The device helps her conserve energy, but her money does not stretch nearly as far as it used to.  \"You just literally watch [the meter] go down and down and down and down and down,\" she said. \\'There\\'s just nothing left to give\\'The worst is yet to come.In April, the energy price cap will soar by 54% ??its largest ever rise ??burdening 22 million people with an annual bill of roughly 짙2,000 ($2,618). Inflation is also expected to peak above 7% and a new payroll tax to help fund health and social care will take effect. Steam and smoke is seen rising from the chimneys and central heating vents of houses in January in London.The higher costs could push the number of \"destitute\" households ??defined as those unable to afford basic necessities ??up by a third to hit 1 million, according to analysis by The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine last month pushed wholesale gas prices up even further as global markets panicked over whether sanctions would hit Russian exports. Analysts at investment bank Investec said Britons\\' annual energy bills after October ??the next time the price cap is adjusted ??could rocket past 짙3,000 ($3,927) as a result. \"Now there\\'s just nothing left to give from people\\'s budgets. There\\'s no way the numbers add up now,\" Lucy Bannister, policy campaigns manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, told CNN Business.\"Children are feeling too scared to ask for the heating to be put on,\" she added. \"They\\'re really kind of taking on that stress that they\\'re seeing their parents go through. Feeling hungry and not asking for a snack.\"The government will try to ease the pain by cutting local taxes and allowing millions of Britons to spread the cost of their energy bills over the next few years. A government spokesperson told CNN Business that it was \"providing support worth around 짙12 billion ($16 billion) this financial year and next, to help households with the cost of living.\"The spokesperson added that the government would raise the minimum wage by more than 짙1,000 ($1,309) a year and hike a benefit claimed by people on low incomes by the same amount. Both will start in April.Critics say the government\\'s response is inadequate and fails to target those who need it most. Ian Allinson, a member of the executive committee at Manchester Trades Union Council, which organized a protest against higher costs in February, said the situation is \"alarming.\" He said the government\\'s plan to delay energy payments won\\'t help vulnerable people.\"We\\'re appalled when the main measure the government has announced [to bring down energy bills] is that we have to give ourselves a loan,\" he told CNN Business. \"A lot of people are struggling with debt already. The idea that there\\'s then enforced further debt rather than any genuine help is just shocking.\"People march through  Manchester on February 12, as protests were held nationally against rising energy bills and the cost of living.Angry Britons are taking to the streets. Protesters, and the opposition Labour Party, have called for a windfall tax on energy companies like BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA), which made billions in profit last year. \"It\\'s just scandalous that the government is choosing to not do something effective to support ordinary people but is happy to leave those mega profits for the companies that are inflicting this on us,\" Allinson said. Paychecks can\\'t keep upAt a north London church, piles of groceries are laid out in a grid on the floor of a small side building. Volunteers are packing the donated items into bags before driving them to people\\'s doors. Cooking Champions, an organization which caters for charitable groups and local businesses, started its delivery service in April 2020 after the pandemic hit. Annalisa Moseley is one of the first to receive her shopping. The mother-of-two said that without Cooking Champions, some weeks she would have no food. Thinking about what will happen after April is stressful, she said.   Volunteers at Cooking Champions in London create food parcels using donated and redistributed food.\"It\\'s all on my shoulders sort of thing to make sure the kids are warm and fed and everything,\" Moseley said. \"It has been getting me down a little bit, but just got to carry on. Keep trying.\"Moseley receives Universal Credit ??a benefit for people who are out of work or on low incomes. The government hiked payments by 짙20 ($26) a week during the pandemic, but that ended in October 2021. The benefit will increase by 3.1% in April, but that\\'s less than half the expected rate of inflation.Rising wages can\\'t keep up either. The Spring Community Hub, a food and clothes bank 15 miles to the south across London, runs another door-to-door delivery service. Lately, volunteers have helped increasing numbers of younger and more affluent people. \"We\\'re seeing more working people and people on those precarious hours particularly,\" CEO Felicia Boshorin told CNN Business. \"When the actual money comes, it\\'s not enough,\" she added.Parents are \\'dreading\\' SeptemberSeptember looms large for parents worried about the cost of school uniforms. Shirts, sweaters and jackets emblazoned with school logos ??mandatory in the United Kingdom ??can run into the hundreds of pounds for a single child.One in 10 British families have fallen into debt buying items needed for school, according to a 2020 survey by The Children\\'s Society, a charity. That figure could grow in 2022 ??clothes and footwear were the biggest contributors to inflation in the month to January, according to the Office for National Statistics. Caroline Rice, who lives in Northern Ireland, is \"dreading\" the new school year. She is a member of Covid Realities, a research project documenting the experiences of low income families during the pandemic. \"I can\\'t afford 짙100 ($131) for oil, so why would I pay 짙50 ($65), 짙60 ($79) for a school blazer?\" she said.Back at The Boiler House, parents are turning up with their children to browse shelves of colorful sneakers, donations provided by charity Sal\\'s Shoes.

For people who have taken on new debts and fallen behind on their bills, there will be a scarring effect that could last for years. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that 4.4 million low income households began borrowing or added to existing debts during the pandemic. Of that number, more than two thirds are behind on their repayments. Joseph De-Ville, another member of Covid Realities, lives in Cornwall with his wife and three children. He got into debt a couple of years ago to pay for his mother\\'s funeral, and told CNN Business about the constant struggle to provide for his family.  \"This is the parts of life that people aren\\'t seeing,\" he said. \"We\\'re locking it up into credit cards so we can cope, and then we\\'re struggling to pay the debts because [of] the interest rates ??because we\\'re having to take high interest rate credit cards just so we can get by.\" For over a decade, real incomes and living standards for millions of Britons have dropped. For De-Ville, the rising cost of living is just the latest chapter of an extended crisis.\"Hardship is harder,\" he said.',\n",
              " 'New York (CNN Business)Starbucks has a love-hate relationship with its cups. The company\\'s white ??or sometimes holiday-themed ??logo-emblazoned paper cups for hot drinks, and clear plastic cups for cold drinks are instantly recognizable symbols of the brand. But that\\'s not entirely a good thing. \"Our cup is ubiquitous, and we love that,\" said Michael Kobori, Starbucks chief sustainability officer. \"But it is also this ubiquitous symbol of a throwaway society.\" That\\'s because the cups are disposable. When they are thrown away, the cups end up in landfills or as litter in streets and waterways. Some might be recycled, but recycling is an imperfect option ??recyclable items still end up in landfills.The best solution? \"Eliminating the disposable cup,\" Kobori said. He called that option \"the holy grail.\"The traditional Starbucks disposable cup.Read MoreBy 2025, the company wants every customer to be able to either use their own mug easily or borrow a ceramic or reusable to-go mug from their local Starbucks. That could mean rolling out more borrow-a-mug programs that require a deposit. Starbucks is also planning, by the end of next year, to let customers use their own personal mugs at every Starbucks in the United States and Canada, even if they order ahead or use the drive-thru. The goals don\\'t mean Starbucks will get rid of the paper and plastic cups. But they do want to make that option less attractive. That won\\'t be easy to do, as most Starbucks customers are used to that simple, single-use option. But the company has a plan. Testing out Borrow-A-Cup programs  Examples of Starbucks\\' reusable cups. To phase out disposables, Starbucks is considering a widespread borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use. Amelia Landers, a vice president of product experience whose team is responsible for sustainable packaging at Starbucks, expects that this model will resonate more with customers compared to other sustainability efforts. \"I think that will take the lead,\" she said. \"We are testing a number of different [borrow-a-cup] programs around the globe,\" including \"20 different iterations and in eight different markets.\" In Seattle, Starbucks tested a beta version of such a program last year.\"We developed a new cup that had a very low environmental footprint, was lightweight polypropylene, ultimately recyclable and could replace 100 single-use disposable cups,\" Landers explained. For that test, customers paid a $1 deposit, and had to return the cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. Customers also earned rewards for using the cup.Kim Davis, who manages a store where the program was tested, said that customers were curious about the bin, and once baristas explained it to them, many were on board with the concept.  \"The excitement and engagement was really high among my customers and my [employees],\" she said. For baristas, the process was straightforward enough ??they just used the reusable cup instead of a regular one to prepare drinks. A third-party company collected the dirty cups for cleaning, so baristas didn\\'t have to worry about that part of the process. Starbucks (SBUX) is running similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.The model is the most promising because it\\'s the easiest to integrate into customers\\' daily lives. You don\\'t have to remember to bring your own reusable mug or, if you do, get stuck with a dirty cup for the rest of the day. And you don\\'t need to sit and sip your coffee at a Starbucks, something most people don\\'t have time for on a weekday morning. But that model is still just being tested, so the company wants to encourage the use of reusable mugs in other ways. Bringing back the personal cup  Starbucks wants all customers to be able to use reusable mugs and glasses at its stores. Early in the pandemic, when people feared that the coronavirus could spread easily on surfaces, Starbucks barred customers from bringing their own mugs. It has since brought back the option and is now trying out ways to make it more attractive. \"We\\'re testing an incentive on the personal cup to go up from where it is today ??from 10 cents to 50 cents,\" Landers said. \"We are also going to be testing a disposable cup fee.\" She added that the chain is also experimenting with discounted prices for people who use a Starbucks-provided ceramic mug in stores. That\\'s simple enough. But it gets a lot more complicated when customers bring their own cups to the drive-thru or when they order ahead through the Starbucks app. Years ago, ordering ahead or using a drive-thru might have been a rare enough occasion. But since the pandemic, more customers have been coming through the drive-thru or ordering ahead.During a February analyst call, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri said that Starbucks\\' drive-thru windows and its mobile orders together account for about 70% of sales at US stores operated by the company.  So to achieve its zero-disposable-cups goal, Starbucks needs to figure out how to get reusables through a drive-thru, and make them available to customers who order ahead. To that end, Starbucks has been testing different options at its innovation center. \"We\\'ve got mock stores set up,\" said Landers. \"We have different versions of the drive-thru layout.\" Customers can simply give their cups to baristas at the drive-thru window. But Starbucks is exploring ways to make the process smoother. Pantene and Stubb\\'s will be sold in reusable containers at some Kroger storesOne option is to allow customers to drop off their cups at an earlier point in the drive-thru lane so that the drink is ready in a personal cup once they swing around to the window, Landers said. Another is for baristas to pre-make drinks when customers place their orders, and pour them into personal tumblers at the window or when they arrive at a store to pick up their order. Starbucks is also testing out cup-washing stations in stores. The team is trying \"different things, over and over again,\" to figure out what might work, she said. \"We\\'re right now in the middle of all of that work.\"It\\'s crucial for Starbucks\\' mobile order and drive-thru experiences to be seamless. After just a few sluggish pickups, customers may take their business elsewhere.But Starbucks also has to be careful not to put too much additional burden on employees, who already have to prepare complicated, customized orders at high speeds. That\\'s especially important now. Workers across the country are considering unionization, going against the wishes of the company\\'s  leadership. A Starbucks, in Buffalo, New York, was the first to vote to unionize in December. Employees at a handful of other stores have since made similar efforts and several Starbucks around the country are preparing for their own votes.If the company\\'s initiative leads to the end of paper and plastic cups at Starbucks, it will be quite an achievement.\"We know that even the most ardent of sustainability champion customers, they really don\\'t change their behavior all that easily,\" Landers said. \"Even though they really, really want to.\" ',\n",

That was well above the estimated 3% increase in a Reuters poll of economists.Industrial production jumped 7.5% during the same period, surpassing the forecast of 3.9%. And investment in fixed assets, such as infrastructure and machinery, jumped 12.2% from a year earlier.\"Under the combined effect of macro policies and the efforts of businesses, the momentum of China\\'s economic recovery has improved in January and February, laying a solid foundation for a good start in the first quarter of this year,\"  said Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the NBS, at a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday.On the policy front, China has significantly boosted its spending on infrastructure, with many local governments kicking off big projects in areas such as electric mobility and semiconductors, Fu added.Read MoreTuesday\\'s data showed that investment in manufacturing surged 21% during January and February from a year ago, much faster than the 13.5% year-on-year growth recorded in the same period in 2021. China sets lowest economic growth target in decades as challenges mountThis is not the first time this year that Chinese authorities have underscored the importance of infrastructure expenditure. Earlier this month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the government would ramp up fiscal and monetary support for the economy this year, including spending more on infrastructure and conducting more interest rate cuts. The government has increased the broad fiscal deficit this year, implying growth in infrastructure investment, wrote Larry Hu, chief economist for Greater China at Macquarie Group, in a report on Tuesday. However, experts warn that there are multiple challenges on the horizon, including Covid and the war in Ukraine.China\\'s new Covid lockdowns are another threat to the economyThe worst Covid-19 surge in two yearsChina is fighting its worst Covid surge since the original outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020.\"With officials ditching targeted containment measures in favor of wholesale lockdowns, this has the potential to be even more disruptive than the Delta wave last Summer, which led to a sharp contraction in economic output,\" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, on Tuesday. Even the government acknowledges that new Covid outbreaks could weigh on the economy in the coming months.\"The recent spread of the coronavirus in many parts of the country may restrict consumption further, and the foundation of the consumption is still not strong,\" Fu said. \"Sporadic outbreaks in some regions will also affect industrial growth.\"China reported 5,154 locally transmitted cases on Monday, the highest number in two years, according to the National Health Commission (NHC).To contain the spread of the virus, authorities have taken strict measures in multiple cities and placed tens of millions of people under various forms of lockdowns.Apple supplier Foxconn halts operations in Shenzhen as China locks down tech hubThe southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, has imposed a week-long lockdown since Monday.

The city is home to Chinese tech giants Huawei and Tencent.Apart from Shenzhen, local authorities in the northeastern province of Jilin have banned residents from leaving or traveling since Monday. The province, with 24 million people, is home to the industrial hub of Changchun, where Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAF) run their car factories in partnership with state-owned car maker FAW Group.Shanghai, the country\\'s largest business center, has also imposed stringent measures after a spike in Covid cases, closing schools and cinemas and restricting travel into the city.\"Indeed, Covid-19 is the biggest uncertainty this year,\" Hu from Macquarie Group said.He predicts that China will grow at 4% in the current quarter. For 2022, he expects the world\\'s second largest economy to grow at 5%, lower than the government\\'s target. Earlier this month, Premier Li set China\\'s economic growth target at around 5.5% for 2022, the lowest official goal in decades.Inflation pressure from the Ukraine crisis China growth may be hit even further by the war in Ukraine.Russia\\'s invasion of its neighbor is pushing up commodity prices and roiling the global economy, at a time when policymakers are already racing to get high inflation under control. Fu from the NBS said the direct impact of the tensions in Europe on China is \"limited,\" as its trade exposure to Russia and Ukraine is \"small.\"But he said the impact on global commodity prices is \"obvious,\" which could increase the pressure of \"imported inflation\" on China.Several food and beverage companies in China have recently hiked prices of their products, including dairy giants Yili and Mengniu.\"The recent acceleration in commodity prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exacerbated the margin pressure on packaged food companies,\" analysts from Morningstar wrote in a report on Tuesday. \"Various food and beverage companies in China have engaged in price hikes since the third quarter last year to mitigate margin compression.\" Analysis: China can\\'t do much to help Russia\\'s sanction-hit economyChina and Russia have forged close ties in recent years, and signed a number of commodities deals during Russian President Putin\\'s visit to Beijing last month. But Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine has put their friendship to the test. Beijing has not rushed to help Russia after the latter\\'s economy was slammed by sanctions from all over the world.

We don\\'t have a place,\\'\" she told CNN Business, breaking into tears. She asked not to publish her real name, for fear of reprisals from current or future employers, and to not worry her family abroad. CNN Business agreed to call her \"Maria.\" Foreign domestic workers are required to live with their employers in Hong Kong, under a longstanding government mandate that has been contested for years.Read MoreMaria, who is from the Philippines, returned to the hospital, where she spent the night sleeping on a chair in the emergency room, along with a friend in a similar situation.

Previously, the requirement was for three weeks. Hong Kong is sticking to zero-Covid, no matter what the costThe issue has increasingly forced companies to rethink where their employees should be based, if only for now. Last month, Mandarin Oriental (MAORF) CEO James Riley told the Financial Times that the former British colony had become a \"very, very poor\" base due to the restrictions.According to the newspaper, the hotel group recently advocated for senior executives to temporarily live abroad, away from its Hong Kong headquarters. Mandarin Oriental declined to comment to CNN Business.Last year, Cathay Pacific (CPCAY) said that it would consider letting some of its pilots live abroad for a few months as aircrew continued to face arduous self-isolation measures. The carrier later said that its workers spent more than 73,000 nights in government-mandated quarantine in 2021.Hong Kong kept out Covid, but exhausted and depressed pilots are paying the priceFrench spirits maker Pernod Ricard (PDRDF) has also asked top executives from its Hong Kong office to work abroad for some time, according to unidentified sources who spoke with the FT. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Meanwhile, other players have moved away entirely.In November, FedEx (FDX) said it would shut down its crew base in Hong Kong and relocate pilots, citing the city\\'s \"pandemic requirements.\"From the start of the pandemic through the end of last year, at least 84 companies have either closed or moved their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong, according to CNN Business calculations based on government data. Asked about the figure, a government spokesperson responded that \"Hong Kong remains a competitive city globally and a major regional base for international companies.\"The representative also pointed to emerging opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, a zone connecting Hong Kong, the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and the city of Macao as \"a market of 86 million people.\" Many banks have honed in on the area as a key priority in the coming years. The government, which includes mainland Chinese companies in its annual tally of international businesses in Hong Kong, said that the number had recently \"risen to a record high of 9,049.\"But the exodus amongst Western players may not slow down this year.

              " 'New York (CNN Business)Surging oil and gas prices have raised recession alarm bells around the world. But another economic indicator is starting to look ominous: The yield curve is flattening.Wall Street closely watches the difference, or spread, between short-term government bond yields, most notably the 2-year Treasury, and longer-term bond rates like the 10-year Treasury. As that spread diminishes, investors worry that the yield curve could eventually invert, meaning that short-term rates would be higher than long-term yields. As of Friday, the difference was just 0.25%, with the 10-year yield at around 2% and the 2-year yielding 1.75%. The gap widened a bit Monday, as the 10-year rose to 2.1% and the 2-year yield was up to about 1.82%, making the spread 0.28%.Inverted yield curve often occurs before recessionsRead MoreAn inverted yield curve has often been a potential recession signal. The yield curve inverted in 2019 before the 2020 Covid-induced recession. It also did so in 2007 before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis/Great Recession. And it inverted in early 2000 right before the dot-com/tech stock meltdown.US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told CNN\\'s Poppy Harlow that a recession is \"a real likelihood\" but he added that \"we have a very strong economy\" and noted that the job market in particular is healthy.When investors want higher rates for short-term bonds, it\\'s an indication that bondholders are nervous. Typically, rates for long-term bonds are higher because you have to wait longer to get paid back. So how worried should investors be that the yield curve might invert?Some argue that the only reason this is happening is because of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting spike in commodity prices. \"The risks of a recession are building but not necessarily immediate unless the global geopolitics dramatically deteriorate from this delicate starting point,\" Jim Reid, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said in a report.The Fed\\'s job just got even harderThe Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later this week, may be careful to not raise rates so aggressively that short-term yields increase even further and wind up flipping the yield curve. That could cause a slowdown in the job market. And the Fed is supposed to keep an eye on unemployment rates as well as inflation.\"Chair [Jerome] Powell will make it clear that the Fed is aware of its dual mandate and does not want to invert the yield curve and produce a recession,\" Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said in a report.  Inflation concerns existed before Russia-UkraineAlthough geopolitical tension could be distorting prices, inflation pressures were already building before the Russian attack on Ukraine.\"Russia/Ukraine is only pulling forward the natural slowing in the economy that would have occurred as the Fed tightened policy,\" said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note last week. Essaye argues that Fed rate hikes and a slowing economy would have likely led to an inverted yield curve at some point later this year even if Russia and Ukraine weren\\'t in the headlines.\"The looming rate hikes (which are still coming) will combine with the growth slowing impulse of higher commodity prices and higher inflation to bring a sooner than previously expected slowing of growth,\" he said.Rising short-term rates could also create problems for large Wall Street firms. Although higher rates tend to boost profits for loans, they also make trading, particularly for bonds, more of a gamble.

But it is unusual to see short-term rates fall this sharply.One strategist noted that it doesn\\'t matter if investors are buying bonds because they perceive them to be safe. There is still a lot to worry about. \"The recession drumbeat is gaining in volume,\" Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, said in a report. \"Of course there are many reasons to be concerned. Soaring inflation, rising energy costs, an almost sure recession in the Euro Zone and a dangerously flat yield curve.\" \"Never mind that the yield curve is being distorted by a massive flight to quality,\" Tengler added. \"An inversion is an inversion.\" ',\n",
              " 'New York (CNN Business)President Joe Biden planned to reshape the Federal Reserve through his nominations for the three vacant seats on the board of governors. But Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia threw a wrench into those plans Monday.The crux of the matter is the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy Treasury secretary and a governor of the Federal Reserve Board during the Obama administration, who is facing opposition in a divided Senate.Raskin\\'s stance on environmental issues, including her view on the transition away from fossil fuels, are colliding with soaring gas prices and a renewed debate about oil independence in the face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\"Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation\\'s critical energy needs,\" Manchin said in a statement on Monday announcing his opposition to Raskin\\'s nomination. Manchin is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee that will be voting on Raskin\\'s candidacy.The US Chamber of Commerce already voiced concern over her nomination to be the vice chair of supervision -- essentially the Fed\\'s top banking regulator -- in January. And a month ago, Senate Republicans boycotted a vote in protest of Raskin\\'s nomination, halting a slate of pending nominees for the central bank.Read MoreThe renomination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for another term is also stalled. Even though Powell is enjoying support on both sides of the aisle, he hasn\\'t been fully confirmed yet, leaving him with the title add-on \"pro tempore\" for now.All this comes at a time when Fed policy has taken center stage amid rampant inflation. Consumer prices haven\\'t risen at this fast a pace since 1982.The central bank is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point this week in an effort to curb demand and bring prices under control.Meanwhile, the White House continued to stand behind Raskin\\'s nomination. Biden has pledged to make the Fed more diverse in terms of both its gender and racial make up. The president also nominated Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook to join the central bank. Cook would be the first Black woman to serve at the Fed in its history.\"Sarah Bloom Raskin is one of the most qualified people to have ever been nominated for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors -- she previously served on the Board and she served as second-in-command at Treasury, both positions where she earned bipartisan Senate confirmation,\" a White House official said.The administration was working to line up bipartisan support for her confirmation, the official added, calling the adversity surrounding her nomination an \"unprecedented, baseless campaign led by oil and gas companies.\"CNN\\'s Manu Raju and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.',\n",
              " 'LondonEnvironmental lawyers ClientEarth said on Tuesday they were preparing legal action against the directors of Shell over the company\\'s climate transition plan, in what they said would be the first such case of its kind.The lawyers from ClientEarth ??which is a Shell shareholder ??said they are seeking to hold the oil and gas company\\'s 13 directors personally liable for what they consider to be a failure to adequately prepare for the global shift to a low-carbon economy. They say that the board has failed to adopt and implement a climate strategy that aligns with the 2015 Paris Agreement, claiming that amounts to an alleged breach of the directors\\' duties under the UK Companies Act.ClientEarth said it had written to Shell notifying it of its claim and was waiting for it to respond before filing papers at the High Court of England and Wales. For the case to proceed, ClientEarth would then need permission from the court to do so.\"We believe that there are sufficient grounds to assert that Shell\\'s board is mismanaging the material and foreseeable climate risk facing the company,\" said ClientEarth lawyer Paul Benson in a statement. \"Unless the board changes course, long-term value will be eroded, and eventually destroyed,\" he added.In a written response to Reuters, Shell said it was delivering on its global strategy that supported the Paris Agreement on climate, including by \"transforming our business to provide more low-carbon energy for customers.\"Read More\"Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires action from all quarters. The energy supply challenges we are seeing underscore the need for effective, government-led policies to address critical needs such as energy security while decarbonizing our energy system. These challenges cannot be solved by litigation,\" Shell said.Court orders Shell to slash CO2 emissions in landmark climate rulingThe legal action comes less than a year after a Dutch court made a landmark ruling that Shell must dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. Shell is appealing that ruling.ClientEarth, a not-for-profit, has a track record of winning climate litigation cases. Last year it won a case against the European Investment Bank, in which the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled it had illegally avoided environmental scrutiny of its financing decisions. In 2020, the company Enea suspended construction of a coal plant in Poland after the group took it to court. The court ruled that authorizing the project was legally invalid. Energy companies are facing a challenge to their business model as countries look to cut use of fossil fuels, a major cause of human-made global warming, and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.Shell has pledged to halve the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 2030, but its plans to reduce emissions from the actual use of its products was not far-reaching enough, ClientEarth said. Shell\\'s net-zero target was also not reflected in the company\\'s operating plans or budgets, ClientEarth added.UN climate scientists have reiterated the need for faster global action and said failure to hit the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms would cause irreparable damage. The UK Companies Act would require Shell to act in a way that promotes the company\\'s success, and to do so whilst exercising reasonable care, skill and diligence.ClientEarth said it was bringing the action as a shareholder in Shell on behalf of all stakeholders to help protect the long-term viability of the company.',\n",

The lack of data and analytic intelligence made it harder to spot trends and more difficult for artists, record labels and venues to navigate the industry. \"We were wandering in the dark,\" says Umek.Enter Slovenian start-up Viberate. Founded in 2015 by DJ Umek and his two managers, Vasja Veber and Matej Gregor훾i훾, the platform gathers data from major streaming sites, global ticket vendors and 24,000 radio stations across 150 countries and translates this into an online profile for musicians. The start-up aims to revolutionize the use of data in the music business. \"The music industry is one of the coolest industries out there, but statistics not so much, and we\\'re joining those two worlds together,\" Veber explains.Viberate\\'s online dashboard offers a range of insights, including chart rankings, social media engagement and fanbase demographics. For the 500,000 artists around the world who use the platform, for a fee of ??9 ($66) per month, the dashboard can help them understand where to focus their promotional efforts. Read More\"I always go and compare my profile to other similar artists ... and then there\\'s a clear sign of where I should invest more time, maybe more money, in a platform or in social media so it will help my career,\" says Umek. Transforming the industryTatiana Cirisano is a music industry consultant and analyst at entertainment intelligence company MIDiA Research. She believes we are witnessing an emerging trend where, rather than releasing music videos for singles ahead of an album release, artists increasingly \"release their albums, go on social media, check the analytics, figure out what songs people seem to like the most and then from there say \\'this is the single, and this is the one that we\\'re going to put our music video budget behind.\\'\" As well as artists, Viberate has 150,000 venues and 6,000 festivals using the site, most notably Insomniac, America\\'s biggest promoter of electronic music festivals, and the UK\\'s Glastonbury Festival. Viberate\\'s analytics dashboard.Analytics has also transformed how record labels operate, says Cirisano. \"Data has completely changed the way that talent scouts at labels work,\" she observes. In the past, scouts \"used to go to gigs and listen to artist demos that got mailed in on a CD ... They\\'d go with a gut feeling,\" whereas the process has now changed to \"looking at data, looking at an artist who seems to maybe be bubbling up and how many streams they get per month.\"The global music streaming market was worth $13.4 billion in 2020, according to industry group IFPI and Spotify adds 60,000 new tracks every day -- so the data helps \"sift through all of the music activity out there,\" explains Cirisano.Predjama: The world\\'s largest cave castleBy recognizing the importance of data, music is following in the footsteps of other industries. \"The movies have IMDb and the tourism industry has Airbnb and Booking.com, and those services were aggregating the entire industry,\" says Viberate\\'s co-founder Veber. Viberate is one of several data analytics companies aimed at the music industry, including Chartmetric, Soundcharts and Songstats. But some worry that too much focus on data analytics could compromise music\\'s inventiveness. \"The music industry is inherently a creative place,\" says Cirisano. \"This is art that we\\'re talking about. It\\'s really hard to take an overly quantitative approach to that.\" Instead, she advocates that data be \"a jumping off point\" by which artists, labels and venues make their decisions. DJ Umek takes it a step further and argues that \"data doesn\\'t kill creativity, it complements it.\" Looking to the future, Viberate\\'s goal is for every musician to be using data. As Veber puts it: \"In five to 10 years, being a musician and not having a profile on Viberate would be the same as being a guitar player without the guitar.\"',\n",

Gri훾 -- meaning literally \"hill\" in Slovenian -- has been in the Ko큄ir family for generations and the restaurant embodies the concept of eating locally. Located 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside of Slovenia\\'s capital Ljubljana, the restaurant has an abundance of fresh produce in its gardens and surrounding forests. It is from here that 80% of the menu\\'s ingredients are sourced and dishes are inspired.\"Our philosophy of getting products in the restaurant is very simple,\" says owner and head chef Luka Ko큄ir. \"When we start to develop a dish, we check our gardens, what grows there. We check the forest, what is growing in the forest.\" Ko큄ir believes it is important to have an intimate understanding of where his produce comes from. For his meats, he relies on local producers in the region, and in 2013 he opened his own organic duck farm. \"It\\'s very important, I think, for each chef not to lose this feeling of how your products come to the table or how somebody has to produce it so that you can serve it,\" says Ko큄ir.

The housing madness shows no signs of slowingAnd whether employees will be returning to the office full-time, a few days a week or periodically throughout the year, it\\'s going to be an adjustment to get back into the flow of office life and socialize face-to-face again, particularly if social distancing and safety measures are still in place. \"It is going to be a little weird at first,\" said Susan McPherson, author of \"The Lost Art of Connecting.\"But socializing and having friends in the office are often good for your career -- especially when it comes to engagement and productivity. Office friendships can also be a benefit for the employer. \"At work, relationships are everything. Just having that space to make mistakes, knowing you can come to your team members and managers about anything, being able to make decisions faster -- all of that is going to affect the company\\'s bottom line, retention rates and employee fulfillment,\" said Stephanie Heath, a career coach.  Read MoreBut how do you break the ice again after more than a year of virtual meetings? Here are some steps you can take.Get the conversation goingAs we dust off our in-person socializing skills, it helps to have a few go-to questions on hand that go beyond typical small talk.  \"Have some meaningful questions that will help you engage with others,\" said McPherson. She suggested asking questions like: Is there anything I can do to help you? Is there somewhere in the world you are planning to visit? If there was a problem you could solve in the next three months what is it and why?\"Questions like that get us to a deeper place, but aren\\'t so personal that they cross the lines of putting people in an awkward position,\" McPherson said. \\'I don\\'t have to choose between lifestyle and career.\\' How remote work changed these people\\'s livesShowing a little vulnerability can also help get conversations flowing, said Heath. For instance, telling someone about how you felt awkward at your first social gathering since the pandemic began can help break the ice. \"When you share something that is semi-embarrassing and start with that...it invites the other person to start sharing,\" Heath said. When it comes to socializing outside of the office, McPherson said to start slow. \"Always defer to the comfort level of others and the state and local guidelines for gatherings. This is not the time to require people to show up who may not feel ready,\" she said. She added that because of the nicer weather coming up, a small picnic or meeting in a park might help with the transition, instead of a happy hour in a bar. Start local When trying to forge social relationships in the office again, Heath suggested starting with your teammates and then with your managers and other leaders. \"You can feel like you are in good standing with everyone that is around you that is on your level, you\\'re laughing and joking again and you have professional \\'persona\\' back on,\" she said. Once you\\'re feeling comfortable, schedule some face time with your direct manager and higher-ups to catch up, hash out any future projects and sort through any pending issues.Reignite your career If 2020 thwarted your career plans and you are still feeling stuck, take this time of transition to reassess your goals. \"Sit down and reaffirm what your goals are,\" said Heath. \"Write them out and create a game plan on how you want to attack it. Include a timeline...once you have that meeting with yourself, then you bring in other people.\" But don\\'t become too focused on yourself, said Laura Gallaher, an organizational psychologist and founder of management consulting firm Gallaher Edge. \"Focus on how you can be really helpful to other members of the team.

              " ' (CNN)There was a period during the winter of 2008 when every Saturday night Paul Newsham\\'s Yorkshire home would sound like old telephone exchange switch room. \"That\\'ll be someone ringing about Mason, to see if he will be playing,\" his wife Julie would say every time the phone rang. The callers were scouts, inquiring as to whether Mason Greenwood, the six-year-old who would develop into Manchester United\\'s prodigiously talented striker, would be featuring the next day for the boys\\' team Newsham coached in the north of England, Idle FC. Greenwood has, clearly, always made an impression on the pitch.How Bruno Fernandes transformed Manchester United\\'s fortunesSince those carefree days as a lightning quick striker playing near his hometown of Bradford, the 18-year-old has become an integral member of an improving United, scoring goals, helping the team rise up the league and, over the last month, talked about as the next great English talent. Read MoreHe may also help United reach the Europa League final, should Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\\'s men overcome Sevilla in Sunday\\'s semifinal. Scoring 10 league goals in an impressive debut season, Greenwood is only the third teenager to score 10 or more English Premier League goals in a single campaign.Former England captain Alan Shearer has said Greenwood could usurp him as the EPL\\'s record scorer. According to former Liverpool player and now football pundit Jamie Redknapp, those at United who have worked with the teenager say he\\'s one of the best the club has ever seen, while another former England star, Gary Lineker, has said it \"won\\'t be long\" until Greenwood is selected by England manager Gareth Southgate. The list of admirers seems endless. But those who follow United closely have known about a young player called Greenwood coming through the ranks for years. Hyperbole and excitement has followed the player from a young age.\\'A different level to everyone else\\'As a six-year-old playing for Idle FC\\'s under-7s, it was the young Greenwood\\'s pace that stood out, recalls Newsham. Shy and small in stature, Greenwood also had an eye for goal, shooting on sight, just as he did for United post-lockdown as the team secured a lucrative Champions League spot by finishing third in the league.  A few days after his sixth birthday, Greenwood made his debut for Idle FC in a match against Silsden Football and Cricket Club, scoring all 10 goals in a 10-1 win. \"I kept having to bring him off because once you had 10 goals you had to stop the game, so I had to bring him off otherwise the game would\\'ve been over too quick,\" recalls Newsham with a chuckle. \"I\\'d keep bringing him off and he\\'d just stick by the side of my leg, looking up at me asking, \\'Can I go on again yet, Paul?\\' He was so happy to be playing.\"From the first training session, his control of the ball at that sort of age was excellent. You could tell watching him he was a totally different level to everyone else.\"Greenwood (2R) celebrates scoring his team\\'s second goal  against Aston Villa on July 9, 2020. Greenwood\\'s scoring ability is a natural talent honed to such an extent that Solskjaer, a man who worked with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, has described him as the deadliest finisher he has seen at such an age. He is only the fourth teenager in United\\'s history, following George Best, Brian Kidd and Rooney, to score 17 goals or more in a season. It was at Idle\\'s annual invitational tournament, involving youth teams in the local area, that Greenwood was set on a path that would lead to Old Trafford. Having impressed onlooking scouts, including United\\'s, shortly after the tournament he started training at United\\'s development centre in Halifax, Yorkshire, eventually signing for the club aged nine. \"I did speak to some scouts at that tournament, I\\'m sure I spoke to a Man Utd scout but I don\\'t recollect it because there were that many coming up to me then asking about him,\" adds Newsham.\"Once he went to Manchester United when he was seven, he couldn\\'t play for us. His dad rung me to say he wasn\\'t allowed to play anymore. I was gutted, but when you go to train with a club like that you can understand why they don\\'t want to play local football.\"Flourishing under SolskjaerGreenwood\\'s rise has been rapid, but of no surprise to his former coach. Aged 14, United gave him a scholarship. Two years later, he was topping the scoring charts in the Under-18s Premier League (north) and being named player of the tournament at the 2018 International Cor Groenewegen Tournament. He also excelled at age group level for England, helping England\\'s Under-18s win the four-team Limoges tournament. Greenwood in action during the international friendly between England U15 and Turkey U15 at St George\\'s Park on December 21, 2015 in Burton-upon-Trent, England.It was under Jose Mourinho that Greenwood made his senior debut for United, against Club America in Phoenix on a pre-season tour in the summer of 2018, but it is under Solskjaer that he has blossomed, particularly excelling once the EPL resumed in June following a 100-day pause because of the coronavirus pandemic. He is now established in the first team, scoring five times in the last eight games of the season, and returned from lockdown with a noticeably more muscular frame than the teenager who started the season on the substitutes\\' bench. \"That\\'s sometimes something you see with young players, that initially you see them and there\\'s evidence of talent, but then there\\'s a point where they develop that extra, whether it\\'s upper body muscle or that edge of pace, to take them away from someone,\" British sports journalist Richard Jolly tells CNN Sport. \"I guess we\\'ll never know what would have happened without the lockdown, but he does seem to have come back from it stronger and looking ready to play every week.\"What sets Greenwood apart from most other players is that he is two-footed, a rare skill acquired thanks to his father who would encourage him to practice with both feet. Twenty minutes before the start of training at United\\'s Halifax center, Greenwood would be shooting with both feet at the bins outside the door, so the story goes. His family, who have shied away from media attention, as has the teenager himself, have been key to his rise, with his father taking him to Moss Side, a relatively deprived area of the city, to play five-a-side football to toughen him up.Greenwood celebrates scoring against Bournemouth at Old Trafford on July 4, 2020.Poised in front of goal, he plays as if time slows when he has the ball and has already proven he can score from all sorts of angles and distances. \"He\\'s genuinely two-footed with his finishing, he scores a good number of goals from outside the box as well as inside,\" adds Jolly. \"For those who believe in expected goals, Greenwood over-performs his expected goals to a huge extent, showing what a good finisher he is. He\\'s not missing chances at all.\"Everyone at United probably knows he\\'s here to stay. He is one for the long term and he\\'s much like [Marcus] Rashford, he\\'s one of those who saved them 50 or 100 million pounds.\"\\'Massively exciting\\'There needs to be some perspective, of course. At the same age, World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe was starring in the Champions League and breaking Thierry\\'s Henry Ligue 1 scoring record. Yet, there is no denying that Greenwood is a wondrous talent. Football is a brutal business and Greenwood has already beaten the odds by making it this far -- according to Michael Calvin in his book \"No Hunger in Paradise\" only 180 of the 1.5 million boys who play organized youth football in England will become a Premier League professional. But throughout his young life, Greenwood has set himself apart from the rest. Kylian Mbappe: The \\'phenomenon that breathes and sleeps football\\'\"With Mason Greenwood, we\\'re actually looking at a player that can be anything he wants to be,\" Mark Goldbridge, presenter for United Stand, tells CNN Sport. \"People are talking about him being up there with the likes of Neymar, Mbappe and Messi. I think that\\'s unfair. But at 18 years of age, I remember Wayne Rooney and there are parallels in different ways, in that he\\'s got a talent that senior, experienced Premier League clubs are struggling to shut him down when he\\'s in full flow off both feet.\"We\\'re really, really excited about what he\\'s going to become at Manchester United.\"The praise directed at Greenwood these last few weeks has been lavish. Should he continue on an upward trajectory, he may have to become accustomed to it. Additional reporting by CNN\\'s Ben Church ',\n",
              " ' (CNN)There hasn\\'t been much to shout about at Manchester United over the last few years. The success enjoyed under legendary manager Alex Ferguson feels like a distant memory for a global fan base that has watched its once great club lurch from one bad decision to another. An FA Cup win in 2016 under Louis van Gaal and Europa League glory under Jose Mourinho in 2017 were two of the highlights in what\\'s been an uninspiring period since Ferguson retired in 2013 -- and a far cry from the 38 trophies won by Scot in his 26 years at the club. The future didn\\'t look much brighter back in January. The club, now managed by former player Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, found itself fifth in the league table by New Year.The football was poor, the atmosphere was toxic and star man Paul Pogba, once seen as the saving grace, looked set to leave as soon as he could. Read MoreWhat I learned from watching 92 games of Premier League football in a rowBut, fast forward seven months, and there are now signs of new life under Solskjaer, most notably since the arrival of one Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese playmaker turned up at Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon in January and was thrown into a team lacking creativity, quality and leadership. Fortunately for his new employees, it seems Fernandes has all three of those attributes in abundance.  Since his debut at the start of the year, United had not lost a game in the league, rising up the table to finish third and qualify for next season\\'s UEFA Champion League for the first time since the 2018-19 season. It was a remarkable feat considering the club started the campaign by making its worst start to a league season in 33 years. What\\'s more, Fernandes brought excitement back to the red half of Manchester after years of uninspiring, and often woeful, performances. His eight league goals and seven assists demonstrate the sort of player United now has on its hands. \"He [Fernandes] told me about the league, how intense it is to play in that league,\" Porto star Danilo Pereira told CNN Sport. \"It\\'s not a surprise for me to see the impact he\\'s had in Manchester. I think United can return to their golden years with him and Pogba and other players.\"READ: Rashford to be awarded honorary doctorate for forcing government U-turnBruno Fernandes had an instant impact on Manchester United. \\'A really, really good signing\\'If such a thing as a typical Manchester United player exists, Fernandes would surely be it. A risk-taker, exciting to watch and able to cope with the extreme pressures of playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world, the attacking midfielder has become an instant hit.He\\'s been a leader from day one; stepping up to take (and score) six penalties during his short spell at the club -- including the pivotal spot-kick against Leicester City which helped United on its way to Champions League football next season. Ex-players and pundits alike have fawned over his performances since he moved to England, where he\\'s won the Man of the Match award in almost every game he\\'s played. \"You can see that he\\'s got the talent and he\\'s not scared. He wants the ball, which I would expect from a very good player,\" former Premier League star and current Monaco player Cesc Fabregas told CNN Sport. \"But what I like is that he\\'s intelligent in terms of moving around the pitch. He knows when to get between the lines. He knows when to go in the space when he sees that someone is available to make a chip. He arrives at the second line fantastically. \"He supports the midfield when they are building up and struggle a little bit, and when teams are putting a lot of pressure on them. \"He can play long, he can play short, little passes. He has the personality to take free-kicks and penalties. He\\'s not scared. He doesn\\'t hide. I think Man United made a really good choice. A really good signing.\"READ: Meet the Manchester United fanatic opening a 33,000-piece museum in FinlandThe playmaker helped fire the club into next season\\'s UEFA Champions League. Instant impactAdapting to the Premier League is no simple feat. It usually takes players time to get used to the physicality and fast paced nature of the league, but it hasn\\'t been a stumbling block for Fernandes.Although his performances in Portugal gave an indication of what was to come, such an instant impact took many by surprise. \"You looked at the player at Sporting Lisbon and clearly he was someone who scored a lot of goals and someone who created a lot of goals, but there\\'s always a challenge as to whether they can translate that to a better league and into a new club,\" British journalist Richard Jolly told CNN Sport, adding that he saw no realistic way of United finishing in the top four without Fernandes.  \"But he\\'s been a transformative player and a revelation in terms of how quickly he\\'s done it, I mean it really was from day one.\"You look at both the goal tallies and the assist tallies, and they\\'re fantastic. If you could maintain that form over the entire season, that\\'s an incredible player there.\" JUST WATCHEDBlack footballers too \\'scared\\' to look at social media due to racist abuse, says ZahaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBlack footballers too \\'scared\\' to look at social media due to racist abuse, says Zaha 03:33Pogba improvement Whilst his individual brilliance is evident, Fernandes\\' arrival has seen the uptick in the form of players around him. The attacking trio of Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford scored at will after football returned from lockdown (the team has scored 22 goals in its last nine league games), and the likes of Pogba and Nemanja Matic have looked more settled in the midfield. Pogba, in particular, is a different player to one who was seemingly weighed down by the pressure of being the biggest star in the starting lineup.The Frenchman\\'s relationship with the club appeared to reach rock bottom earlier this season, with constant rumors linking the midfielder with a move away from the club. Fans also grew frustrated with Pogba for spending much of the season on the treatment table after suffering two ankle injuries. When they did catch a glimpse of him on the field, he often underwhelmed.  But now, since he returned from his latest injury after lockdown, there have been early signs that a partnership with Fernandes could flourish and the World Cup winner suddenly looks more comfortable. \"I think Pogba likes to be surrounded by big players and big characters in their own right, I don\\'t think he wants to be the only big name there, and thus have all the pressure lumped on him,\" Jolly said.\"I think he probably doesn\\'t want to be in a midfield where he\\'s surrounded by mediocrities. I think you\\'ve seen signs already of a bit of chemistry between Pogba and Fernandes which helps, but I think he also just appreciates the element that he\\'s playing with other quality players around him.\" Paul Pogba has vastly improved since Fernandes joined. The new Cantona? Fernandes had been linked to a move to Old Trafford throughout 2019 and there had been disappointment when the deal wasn\\'t completed in time for the new season. So, when the transfer got over the line in January for an initial $61 million (짙47m), fans were ready to see what all the fuss was about. It\\'s safe to say they haven\\'t been disappointed. Mark Goldbridge, a United supporter and presenter of fan channel The United Stand, cannot wait to see how the team develops. \"I sort of liken it to what Eric Cantona did when he came to Manchester United from Leeds [in 1992] and we won our first Premier League title,\" he said. \"It was sort of the kick-start for some real success.\"Now, I\\'m not saying Bruno Fernandes is going to lead Manchester United to the same level of success that Cantona did but he\\'s not just one player coming in and making us great. \"It\\'s one player that\\'s come in and made everybody else around him better.\" It\\'s easy to forget that Fernandes has only been at the club for a matter of months but he\\'s already established himself as a firm fan favorite -- with one particular moment, in a game against local rivals Manchester City, a defining one of his short time at the club. Fernandes got involved with a sideline feud with Pep Guardiola, resulting in the Portuguese player putting his finger to his lips and shushing the City manager. \"I think Bruno, in a very short period of time, has certainly come in and really grasped what Manchester United is all about,\" said Goldbridge.\"Ultimately, there\\'s a thin line between grasping what Manchester United is all about and actually just being somebody who loves the game, wants to play the game in the right way, and is passionate to win.\"I remember his little argument with Pep when we played Man City, and the fans loved that because I think Fernandes just wants to win.\" READ: Rashford, the gifted Manchester United star who became a remarkable activistFernandes has provided United\\'s front three with more chances. Another false dawn?Whilst United\\'s form dropped for the final two games of the season, fans will be holding on to those encouraging signs of life and hoping this isn\\'t yet another false dawn at the club. The third-place finish, although not befitting of the club\\'s true ambition, must be seen as progress and attention can now turn to winning the Europa League, which is set to resume on August 5.  United face a simple task in their second-leg tie against LASK on Wednesday, leading 5-0 from the first leg and all but guaranteed a place in the quarterfinals. Although winning European football\\'s secondary club cup competition is nothing to be smirked at, the real prize is still the Premier League. Despite all the improvements seen at the club in recent weeks, the gulf between it and the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City remains wide -- it finished 33 points behind eventual champion Liverpool this season. A productive summer in the transfer market could be just what United needs, and Borussia Dortmund\\'s Jadon Sancho is just one of the names being linked with a switch to Old Trafford.There had been signs of success during both Van Gaal and Mourinho\\'s time at the club but something does feel different about United under Solskjaer.Maybe a return to its glory days aren\\'t too far away. \"It does look more sustainable and one of the things that they\\'re doing is they\\'re not just beating teams but, if you look at that winning run, they\\'ve won quite a lot of those games comfortably and quite emphatically, and, quite entertainingly,\" said Jolly. \"I think what you might see next year is not necessarily United winning the league but them getting in the top four a lot more comfortably.\"',\n",

Inspired by the spelbinding performances of Pel챕 -- he wore the number 10 jersey  -- the yellow shirt has represented Brazil\\'s success on the pitch and created a positive image worldwide for the past five decades.That 1970 national team also became embroiled in politics, notably ahead of the World Cup in Mexico when General Medici, the president of a nation under military dictatorship, played a key role in the removal of the coach -- Joao Saldanha -- who had overseen a perfect qualification campaign.Fast forward to 2020 and critics of Bolsonaro say the iconic yellow jersey has now become tainted by its close association to the Brazilian president.  President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro celebrates with the trophy and the players of Brazil after winning the Copa America final against Peru.Walter Casagrande, a former footballer for the Brazilian national team and the S찾o Paulo club Corinthians, remembers the feeling of scoring a goal while wearing the yellow jersey in his first match with the \"selecao\" in 1985.Read More\"It was a magical thing,\" Casagrande told CNN Sport, \"like an enchanted object that gave me huge emotion.\"  Casagrande\\'s sentiments lie on the left side of the political chasm separating Bolsonaro\\'s supporters and opponents, and he feels an item he cherishes is being misrepresented.\"Now I consider the Brazilian yellow jersey to have been kidnapped and appropriated by the right wing, so we cannot use it.\" Casagrande said that for him the power of the yellow shirt used to be that it represented democracy and freedom.\"Brazil is appearing horribly to the world right now,\" he said. \"It\\'s the first time in my life I\\'m seeing the yellow jersey being used against democracy and freedom.\" Supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro pray during a motorcade and protest혻against the National Congress and the Supreme Court over lockdown measures amidst혻on the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in front the National Congress on May 09, 2020 in Brasilia.A demonstrator holds a sign that reads \"Go Away Bolsonaro, General elections now!\" during a rally against President Jair Bolsonaro and Governor of Rio de Janeiro Wilson Witzel amidst the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic at Copacabana beach on June 28, 2020 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.READ: 50 years on, 1970 World Cup-winning team remains Brazil\\'s greatest ever\\'It\\'s not about politics\\'As quick as the left is to criticize Bolsonaro, his supporters aren\\'t slow to counter punch.Cosmo Alexandre, a Brazilian fighter who holds multiple world titles for Muay Thai and Kickboxing believes the left is conflating their many issues with Bolsonaro, and using the jersey as just another way to air grievances. As a Bolsonaro supporter, Alexandre brushes off accusations that the jersey\\'s symbolism is being manipulated, and says the reason for supporters to wear a yellow t-shirt is simple: everyone in Brazil has a yellow t-shirt.He points out that supporters don\\'t always wear the Brazilian team jersey specifically, and rallies are full of people wearing yellow t-shirts of all kinds.  Alexandre says there is a separation between the jersey\\'s sporting reputation and associations from what it politically represents.\"Around the world everybody knows about the Brazilian soccer team, so even if I go to a fight and I use the yellow soccer team shirt, everyone knows it\\'s Brazil,\" he said. \"So it\\'s not about politics -- it\\'s just that the world knows about soccer in Brazil.\"It may be easier for some than others to isolate football and politics in a country where football is God.Josemar de Rezende Jr. is a football fan who co-founded a Bolsonaro volunteer group in his city before the election.

It was the talismanic figures of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe who combined to help deliver the victory as two precise passes allowed for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting to prod in the winning goal and seal a stunning comeback. \"I knew because of the group that we have, the great family that we have made, it was impossible that we were going to be knocked out, impossible,\"  Neymar told reporters. \"I could only think about the ball coming to me to try and score, or for a teammate to try and score to have the chance to go through to the semifinals.\"Read MoreVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featureNeymar (left) and Mbappe celebrate after PSG take the lead against Atalanta. These two quarterfinal opponents couldn\\'t have been pitched further apart in terms of expectations; this season was Atalanta\\'s first in the Champions League, while PSG has been burdened by expectations in the competition since Qatari owners took over the club in 2011 and welcomed a host of expensive signings. When Neymar, who was signed for a world record fee of $263 million in 2017, squandered a one-on-one opportunity inside the first three minutes -- driving deep into the Atalanta half only to fluff his shot in front of goal -- it set the tone for what for 90 minutes was a frustrating evening for the French champion. The Brazilian slashed another shot wide just before halftime but also showed flashes of brilliance, nutmegging Atalanta goalscorer Mario Pasalic and skipping past a number of other players as he pushed for an equalizer. Despite missed chances in front of goal, it was Neymar\\'s man-of-the-match performance that dragged PSG through this game and out the other side.His 16 dribbles were the most in a Champions League match since Lionel Messi against Manchester United in 2008, according to Opta, and he also won nine fouls as he continued to probe the Atalanta defense before assisting Marquinhos\\' equalizer and creating Choupo-Moting\\'s winner.Injured in the two previous seasons when PSG was knocked out by Manchester United and Real Madrid in the last 16, Neymar showed his worth against Atalanta in Lisbon.READ: PSG breaks Atalanta\\'s heart with stunning Champions League comebackJUST WATCHEDNeymar speaks to CNN after joining PSGReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNeymar speaks to CNN after joining PSG 02:16\"The guy is totally reliable when it comes to pressure,\" said manager Thomas Tuchel, whose side reached a first Champions League semifinal in 25 years. \"When it comes to knockout games you can rely on Ney, he loves it.

That should tell you something, I knew we were going to have some negative pushback from having a unified response over what\\'s going on. That\\'s the problem, that\\'s a problem.\"CNN has contacted MLS but has yet to receive a response. In July, members of Black Players for Change (BPC), an organization which has pledged to address racial inequalities in MLS and the sport, each raised a gloved fist before the league\\'s first match following its resumption and silently knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds, a reference to the killing of George Floyd in May which sparked worldwide protests.The Black players were dressed in black shirts with slogans that read \"Silence is Violence,\" \"Black All The Time,\" and \"Black and Proud.\" Their black face masks said \"Black Lives Matter.\" The pre-match demonstration has been featured in a short documentary, which runs for eight minutes and 46 seconds, about the foundation of BPC.Eight minutes and 46 seconds represents the duration prosecutors initially reported Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd\\'s neck.Prosecutors have since changed that assessment to seven minutes and 46 seconds.',\n",

Ronaldo comfortably dispatched his first penalty.The Manchester United forward was lining up for his second penalty of the match just a few minutes later, dusting himself down after he was brought down by Luxembourg goalkeeper Anthony Moris. The referee ordered Ronaldo to retake his second successful penalty for encroachment, but he comfortably extended Portugal\\'s lead to two on his second attempt. Manchester United teammate Bruno Fernandes added a third goal just before the 18-minute mark as Portugal threatened to run up a cricket score, but Luxembourg held firm to keep the margin at three until Joao Palhinha headed home from a corner midway through the second half. The Sporting midfielder celebrated with an ode to Ronaldo\\'s trademark \\'Siuuuu\\' jump -- a tribute that Ronaldo would have undoubtedly enjoyed more than Andros Townsend\\'s homage following his equalizer against United two weeks ago.

              " ' (CNN)The European Union is running the risk of winding up its most important ally next month, after the bloc agreed to send a team to observe Venezuela\\'s regional elections, set to take place on November 21. The vote comes after three particularly chaotic years in the country, where President Nicolas Maduro has managed to stay in power despite a collapsing economy, a contested election result in 2018 and US-backed efforts to remove him from power through coordinated Western sanctions -- which involved the EU. However, earlier this year, the bloc dropped its recognition of Maduro\\'s opponent, Juan Guaid처, as the legitimate president, placing it at odds with the US who still recognize Guaid처.In some corners of the US, this has caused concern that by sending a delegation to the country for the first time since 2006, the EU will lend legitimacy to a process that will ultimately be won by Maduro, a strongman leader often described as a dictator. A Venezuelan national flag flutters during a mass opposition rally against President Nicolas Maduro in which Venezuela\\'s National Assembly head Juan Guaido (out of frame) declared himself the country\\'s \"acting president\", on the anniversary of a 1958 uprising that overthrew a military dictatorship, in Caracas on January 23, 2019. Andr챕s Oppenheimer wrote in the Miami Herald last week that for the past 16 years, \"the EU had refused to send electoral observation missions to Venezuela, mainly because it considered, rightly, that elections there were a sham.\"Read MoreHe concludes that on election night, \"the EU mission will probably announce that there were no major irregularities, and an ecstatic Maduro will claim that he won a clean election. And several months later, when the EU mission puts out its final report looking at the entire election process and concluding that it wasn\\'t a fair race, the election will be long forgotten.\" Diplomatic sources have confirmed to CNN that this is not just the fear of a columnist, but there are very real concerns that Maduro will, whatever the EU\\'s intentions, be able to spin this to legitimize his grip on power. Why would the EU be willing to do this and risk the ire of its most important ally? First, Brussels sources refute the idea that this will give the elections a de-facto EU stamp of approval. They say that their agreement rests on the fact that the Venezuelan National Electoral Council invited a delegation. Brussels then sent a mission to see if elections could be monitored \"along the 2005 UN guidelines,\" an EU official said, pointing out that the bloc had not recognized elections held in the country last year. \"We go there not to legitimize the regime, but to see what is happening.\"Guaid처 remains in Caracas but his efforts to assume interim power have run aground.Second, the official says that \"there is no difference in how we monitor Iraq, Peru, Pakistan or Mali. This is one of the most recognized election monitors in the world and if our partners ask us, we will explain our logic. We don\\'t have to justify ourselves to anyone.\"It is certainly true that electoral monitoring groups frequently operate in and report on polls that are far from free or fair. For example, in 2017, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, a highly respected organization, delivered a scathing report on the Turkish independence referendum. However, critics might argue that the context here is different. Turkey is a NATO ally whose democratic standards had been sliding for years. This was a documentation of that decline -- which enraged President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. What\\'s different is Venezuela\\'s comparative isolation from the West. It is arguable that even if the EU returns a highly critical report, its mere engagement in the process could be used as propaganda by Maduro. A State Department spokesperson said to CNN that the US \"considers free and fair local, National Assembly, and presidential elections essential for Venezuelans to reach a peaceful and democratic solution to the crises their country faces. In statements made jointly with the United States on June 25 and August 14, the European Union and Canada made clear they share our views ... For further questions about the EU\\'s planned election observation mission, we refer you to EU officials.\"These sort of tensions between the Brussels and Washington are to some extent inevitable as the EU tries to grow its influence as a distinct global power and defender of Western values, rather than an extension of US influence. However, the bloc must remember that each time it diverges from American policy -- be it on China, Russia or Venezuela -- it will be noticed by the leadership of the nation that still towers above all else on the world stage.

              " 'London (CNN)The British government failed to act quickly enough in its initial Covid-19 response, enabling the virus to spread rapidly through communities and resulting in thousands of deaths, lawmakers said in a damning report published Tuesday.The report, an initial assessment by the British Parliament\\'s Health and Social Care, and Science and Technology committees, said the United Kingdom\\'s Covid response was slow and \"reactive.\"Among the biggest failures of the government\\'s approach was an initial policy at the start of the pandemic of trying to manage the spread of Covid, rather than stop it spreading altogether, the lawmakers said. They also criticized a delayed lockdown, failures in the UK\\'s contact-tracing program, and a lack of attention given to the most vulnerable, specifically those in the social care sector and at-risk communities -- namely Black, Asian and other ethnic minorities. The report also said there was little interest in learning from the experiences of other countries, such as those in East Asia that were the first to deal with the pandemic. One bright spot for the UK government, however, is the speedy and effective deployment of its vaccine program, the report highlighted. Read MoreThe 150-page report is the result of a cross-party inquiry, which began in October 2020, examining the initial UK response to the pandemic. It contains 38 recommendations to the government and public bodies, and draws on evidence from more than 50 witnesses and 400 written submissions.Herd immunity and delayed lockdownThe report said the government -- backed by scientific advisers -- made a \"serious early error\" during the first three months of the pandemic by not rigorously moving to stop the virus\\' spread, an approach adopted by many East and Southeast Asian countries.\"This amounted in practice to accepting that herd immunity by infection was the inevitable outcome,\" the report said, with the likely result in \"hundreds of thousands of deaths.\"The UK\\'s troubled coronavirus response becomes more complicatedThe UK has reported 138,167 fatalities from Covid-19 since the pandemic started, according to Johns Hopkins University data -- more than any other country in Western Europe.Other countries and places in Europe and Asia, including China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea, implemented strict border controls, social distancing and early lockdowns as soon as cases emerged -- some as early as January 2020 -- to control the pandemic.The report said there was a degree of \"groupthink\" between official scientific advisers and the government in which ministers did little to question the advice they received and that meant the UK was \"not as open to approaches being taken elsewhere.\" This led to a delay in the nationwide lockdown, which was imposed in the UK on March 23, 2020.\"However, even when UK policy had changed to bring in a comprehensive national lockdown, the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions against Covid-19 was complex, inconsistent and opaque for most of the rest of 2020,\" the report added.\\'Test and Trace\\'Another area the report vehemently criticized is the UK\\'s \"Test and Trace\" program. The report referred to Public Health England\\'s efforts as \"poor\" and concluded that ultimately the program \"failed.\"\"Despite being one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for Covid in January 2020, the United Kingdom failed to translate that scientific leadership into operational success in establishing an effective test and trace system during the first year of the pandemic,\" the report said.The report said it was a \"serious mistake\" to stop community testing early in the pandemic and national public bodies failed to share data with each other, including between national and local governments.Late and leaky. How the UK failed to impose an effective quarantine system  \"A country with a world-class expertise in data analysis should not have faced the biggest health crisis in a hundred years with virtually no data to analyze,\" the report said. \"What was being achieved in other countries, particularly East Asia, appeared to be of little interest in the initial weeks of the pandemic,\" the report added. \"This was an inexcusable oversight.\"The report said despite vast sums of taxpayers\\' money being directed toward the \"Test and Trace\" program, it never fully delivered at preventing additional lockdowns and \"were it not for the success of the Vaccine Taskforce and the NHS vaccination program, it is likely that further lockdown restrictions would have been needed in Summer 2021.\"At-risk communities The report also criticized the lack of attention given by the UK government to the most vulnerable, specifically those in the social care sector and at-risk communities, namely Black, Asian and other ethnic minorities.\"It is telling that the first ten NHS staff to die from Covid-19 were from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, and evidence has since confirmed that the impact of Covid-19 on this section of the workforce has been significant,\" the report said. People from ethnic minorities are up to 50% more likely to die from coronavirus than white people, UK report findsThe lawmakers said it was a \"mistake\" to allow patients to be transferred from hospitals to care homes \"without adequate testing or rigorous isolation\" shown in places like Germany and Hong Kong. \"This, combined with untested staff bringing infection into homes from the community, led to many thousands of deaths which could have been avoided,\" the report said. In its recommendations, the report said the government should ensure its \"levelling up\" agenda includes \"specific policies to reduce health inequalities, with a particular focus on ensuring that certain groups, including people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, do not continue to face unequal health outcomes.\"Vaccine successOne area of the UK\\'s pandemic performance that succeeded was its speedy vaccine development and effective deployment, the report said.\"The government presciently identified that a vaccine would be the long-term route out of the pandemic and supported the research and development of a number of Covid-19 vaccines,\" the report said.It added the program \"has been one of the most effective initiatives in the history of UK science and public administration\" and a result of which is \"millions of lives will ultimately be saved.\"',\n",

Because of the disease, Stark has been in two induced comas and has undergone a tracheostomy. He remembers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder with the \"dreams of the comas actually causing trauma\" after his second. And that is how he came to find boxing, the sport he describes as providing him the gift of \"being myself, feeling comfortable, feeling vulnerable.\"Through his journey in boxing, Stark has come to organize the World Gay Boxing Championships (WGBC), the world\\'s first LGBTQI+ boxing tournament, which will be held in Sydney in 2023. Read MoreThe slate of events, which have been backed by Boxing Australia as well as most of the sport\\'s leading organizers and administrators, will feature amateur fighters of different weights, ages and abilities. As well as introducing the sport to a whole new audience, Stark hopes that the WGBC can \"disrupt homophobia, transphobia, hatred in sport.\"\"I think the main thing is around visibility and representation,\" he told CNN Sport. \"There have been trailblazers in the world of boxing. You think women were not able to compete in boxing at the Olympics until 2012. Think what Nicola Adams has achieved.

Previously, he had considered the sport to be \"barbaric.\" But it has become a safe space.Because of the masculine nature of the sport, many might consider boxing very \"heteronormative,\" according to Stark. But as a member of the LGBTQI+ community, he has come to find the sport extremely inclusive. \"Boxing is for everybody,\" he says.\"I\\'ve found the sport, from my personal experience, to be very inclusive.

He remembers calling himself \"the future world gay boxing champion\" as a joke. He did have dreams of boxing at the 2022 Gay Games, but the sport was eliminated from the upcoming games -- postponed until 2023 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Like the Bingham Cup -- a biennial, international, non-professional, gay rugby union tournament -- he hopes that the WGBC can encourage young members of the LGBTQI+ community with an interest in boxing to try the sport. But as well as encouraging engagement with the sweet science, Stark hopes he can have an effect on stopping homophobia and transphobia in sport. According to one study, 80 percent of the more than 12,000 participants from across the world have witnessed or experienced homophobia in sports. The study also found that 78 percent of the participants believed that an openly gay person would not be very safe as a spectator at a sporting event. Although he has been subjected to the \"typical trolling on social media\" as a result of the foundation of the WGBC -- something he\\'s ignored -- he believes it can make a difference. \"There\\'s more work to be done, but really it\\'s at that grassroots and amateur level.

Union leaders have warned of the disruption to education posed by continued Covid-19-related absences.\"We are hearing from schools where there are 10 percent or more of pupils absent and where staff are also off work because of the virus,\" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said in a statement Tuesday. \"Teaching and learning is very difficult in these circumstances and it is clear that the educational disruption of the past 18 months is far from being over.\"The figures emphasize the importance of the vaccination program for 12- to 15-year-olds, Barton said. \"The anti-vaccination campaign that is taking place is extremely unhelpful and we urge parents and students who have any concerns as a result of this campaign to seek out reliable and official sources of information.\"UK Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi warned Thursday that children could be required to wear masks again in the classroom if the Covid-19 situation worsens significantly.\"Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90%, that obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates.

They claimed that the defendants should be liable to pay 10,000 euros (approximately $11,600) in compensation to each survivor in compensation \"because of the Catholic Church\\'s policy of silence on the issue of sexual abuse.\" In October 2013, the Ghent Court declined jurisdiction in respect of the Holy See, the ruling said. On Tuesday, the ECHR ruled 6-1 in the case of J.C. and Others v. Belgium, saying that the Vatican is a sovereign state that can not be sued, and that there had been nothing \"unreasonable or arbitrary\" in the Belgian courts\\' adopting that position.The court\\'s decision, however, is not final and any party can request an appeal, known as a \"Grand Chamber review,\" within three months of the ruling.Tuesday\\'s ruling comes as the Catholic Church is facing a reckoning on sexual abuse, with a growing number of survivors fighting for justice. The arms of the Holy See on the facade of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome in November 2017.Last week a landmark report found that France\\'s Catholic clergy sexually abused an estimated 216,000 minors over the past seven decades, and that the Church had prioritized the protection of the institution over victims who were urged to stay silent.The number of abused minors rises to an estimated 330,000 when including victims of people who were not clergy but had other links to the Church, such as Catholic schools and youth programs, according to the report. Between 2,900 and 3,200 abusers were estimated to have worked in the French Catholic Church between 1950 and 2020, out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics, the report found.The day after its release, Pope Francis called the report \"a moment of shame,\" and called upon leaders of the Church to ensure \"similar tragedies\" never happen again. Francis also assured sexual abuse survivors of his prayers and said: \"I wish to express my sorrow and my pain to the victims for the trauma that they have suffered and also my shame, our shame, my shame for the too long incapacity of the church to put them at the center of its attention.\"Ongoing allegations of abuseWhile the Church has taken \"important steps\" to prevent sexual violence in recent years, the report described them as reactive and insufficient, warning that although \"these acts of violence were in decline up until the early 1990s, they have since stopped decreasing. In France, abuse of minors within the Church accounts for close to 4% of all sexual violence in France, according to Jean-Marc Sauv챕, the president of the Independent Commission on Sexual Abuse in the Church (CIASE) which authored the report.The Pope did not directly address allegations of ongoing abuse in his comments last Wednesday, with some survivors and advocates saying that further action is needed to reform an institution plagued with sexual exploitation that has only itself to answer to.Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, which campaigns for survivors of abuse by Catholic clergy, said that Tuesday\\'s ruling is \"a galling reminder of the Vatican\\'s impunity, made possible by its status as a sovereign state. The notions endorsed by the ruling, that the Pope isn\\'t the boss of his bishops and that the Holy See didn\\'t authorize the bishops\\' cover-up of abuse, are demonstrably untrue.\"Priest: The question I was asked after the French Catholic Church sexual abuse reportDoyle added in a statement: \"The church\\'s dual identity as a religion and a state allows it to shape-shift according to the threat it faces in courts ... No other religious institution enjoys the same buffet of legal protections. The result is that the church repeatedly evades justice and its untold millions of victims are left to suffer.\" On Wednesday, a Vatican tribunal on absolved a former altar boy on charges that he sexually abused a fellow student at a seminary located inside Vatican City. Fr. Gabriele Martinelli, now 29, was a student at the St Pius X Seminary at the time when the alleged abuses occurred, from 2007-2012. Martinelli was accused of molesting a younger student while they were both minors. In addition to Martinelli, the seminary\\'s former rector, Fr. Enrico Radice was also absolved of charges of cover-up.  The trial was the first of its kind dealing with abuses alleged to have occurred at the Vatican. The St. Pius X Seminary houses boys aged 12-18 who are considering the priesthood and who serve mass at St. Peter\\'s. In May, Francis ordered that the seminary find a new home outside the Vatican.

But other zero-Covid countries in the Asia-Pacific region will also be watching closely to see if Sydney can succeed in keeping case numbers and deaths low enough to avoid overwhelming hospitals, while still allowing business to resume and people to get on with their lives.Diners sit at a cafe in Sydney, Australia on October 11 as the city emerges from lockdown.The end of zero CovidFor the first year of the pandemic, Australia was one of the few major nations to successfully control Covid-19, through strict border restrictions, mandatory quarantine and temporary lockdowns.But in June a Delta outbreak in Sydney quickly spread to the neighboring state of Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Delays to Australia\\'s vaccination rollout, partly due to low supplies, left the population vulnerable -- forcing authorities to impose local lockdowns.Analysis: Australia beat the world on shutting out Covid. Now it is bitterly divided on how to reopen \"I was always of the belief that we could have eliminated the non-Delta Covid ... but I concede lockdowns with Delta are often going to be an unwinnable contest,\" said Mary-Louise McLaws, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University of New South Wales (UNSW).As case numbers rose, it became clear that keeping people inside was unsustainable -- for economic and health reasons -- and Australian authorities came up with a plan to vaccinate the country out of the pandemic. With early supply issues resolved, the vaccination program went into overdrive. Last week, NSW became the first state to reach the initial 70% double vaccination target. Other states are expected to reach that number in the coming weeks, and by the end of the year the entire country is expected to open up.But experts warn it\\'s not without potential dangers -- and some people are bearing more of the risk than others.Reopening Australia Australia\\'s reopening plan is built around total adult vaccination rates in each state, but inoculation statistics are not evenly spread.In some suburban areas of Sydney, full vaccination rates are as low as 30%, according to government figures. The state\\'s Indigenous population is also trailing statewide numbers. For example, as of October 6, fewer than half of Indigenous people aged 15 or over on the NSW Central Coast had received both vaccine doses. That\\'s a problem because Indigenous people generally suffer more chronic health issues than non-Indigenous people, putting them at greater risk of Covid complications. And young people are also of concern. In NSW, only 58% of people age 16 to 29 have been fully vaccinated -- the lowest of any age group besides 12 to 15-year-olds, who were only recently given access to vaccines.  Customers line up to enter a store in Sydney on October 11 after more than 100 days of lockdown.McLaws from UNSW said young people are likely to be among the first to take advantage of the freedoms afforded by reopening, so ensuring they are fully vaccinated is especially important. She compared it to patches of dry kindling which, if ignored, could eventually spark a bushfire. \"Young people, they start the fire, and then those groups that are at risk ... are the vulnerable and the Indigenous population and just generally regional areas outside the big cities,\" she said. Australia\\'s strict border controls and quarantine measures allowed the country to avoid the chaos experienced in other countries in 2020, when Covid cases spilled over from hospitals into temporary medical units.However, despite 18 months of preparation, health groups have warned the NSW hospital system may not be able to cope with a surge of new infections.Qantas repatriation flight sets aviation recordLast month the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association urged the state government to boost staffing levels, citing research showing the system was under pressure even before the latest Covid outbreak.And on Thursday, after NSW\\'s new premier announced a speedier reopening plan, Omar Khorshid, head of the Australian Medical Association, urged authorities not be \"reckless\". \"The ultimate outcomes of opening too fast or too early will be avoidable deaths and the reintroduction of lockdowns and other restrictions -- things no-one in NSW wants to see,\" he said in a statement.\"Sydney must take this opportunity to show the rest of the country how to live with COVID whilst protecting health and health care.\"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country\\'s states have had 18 months to prepare for higher Covid cases -- and the \"planning is well in place.\"He also urged Australians to play a role in taking pressure off the system.\"Where there\\'s no cases, or whether there\\'s 500 cases, or indeed 1,500 cases a day. The best thing you can do to support nurses and all those working in hospitals is to get vaccinated,\" he said. A doctor administers the Pfizer vaccine to a client at the Belmore Sports Ground vaccination hub on October 3 in Sydney, Australia.\\'Setting a \\'good example\\'Australia is starting its transition from zero Covid to living with the virus through a high vaccination rate -- but it isn\\'t the first country in the region to do so. In June, the Singaporean government announced it was going to focus on limiting severe Covid-19 cases and lowering hospitalizations rather than infection rates. Singapore has one of the world\\'s highest vaccination rates -- 83% of its total population is fully inoculated.But after it began to relax restrictions, Singapore saw Covid-19 cases soar to their highest numbers since the start of the pandemic. In early October, the country reimposed some restrictions to curb rising infections and take pressure off the health system. Last week, the number of people allowed to gather dropped from five to two, work-from-home became the standard, and classes were suspended or moved online for students aged 12 and under.Australia is also expecting case numbers to rise -- that\\'s inevitable as people start mixing, even while following other public health advice, including wearing masks.NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet receives a haircut on October 11, following the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in the state.National modeling from the Doherty Institute predicts that with \"partial public health measures\" and a 70% double vaccination rate, numbers could rise to 385,000 cases and 1,457 deaths over six months -- more than Australia\\'s total toll over the entire pandemic. Greater vigilance could see those numbers drop, it added.Ahead of the reopening, Australia\\'s leaders have been careful to prepare their citizens for more deaths, casting it as the cost of getting back to normal life.But like Singapore, Australia has not ruled out reintroducing tighter restrictions if cases rise too quickly.Apart from Singapore and Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Vietnam have all spoken about abandoning an elimination strategy. In some of those places, that has already prompted concern -- in New Zealand, commentators have raised fears the move could spell disaster for the country\\'s most vulnerable.  Experts said countries around the region will be looking to Sydney to see how successfully it moves to reopen -- and to learn from its mistakes.New Zealand to abandon zero-Covid strategy as Delta variant proves hard to shakeAnd not only other countries -- Morrison is keen to move ahead quickly with a nationwide reopening, and Australia\\'s other states and territories will have a close eye on NSW.Victoria, Australia\\'s second largest state, will likely be the next to reopen later in October.Paul Griffin, director of Infectious Diseases at Mater Health Services, said other governments would be particularly interested in how Sydney\\'s health system holds up after reopening.\"I don\\'t think case numbers will be the key metric,\" he said. \"I think it will be markers of significant disease, and intensive care admission and, of course, the death rate.\"If hospitals get overwhelmed by infections, and can\\'t perform normal services safely, that would be a \"red flag,\" he said.McTighe, the Sydney resident, said she still believes the original lockdown was necessary and doesn\\'t expect the reopening to necessarily be smooth -- there might be a rise in cases and a reintroduction of restrictions, she said.But for now, she said she is very excited to live \"a normal life again.\" \"You can see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel.\"',\n",

The BBC reported that in an email sent by the Premier League to its clubs in September the organization said: \"Only seven clubs\\' squads are more than 50% fully vaccinated, so we have a way to go.\"It is increasingly clear that full vaccination will be the key criteria for government and health authorities, in terms of international travel and potential Covid certification at large-scale events.\"CNN has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the letter.Read MoreCurrently, 85.4% of the UK population aged 12 and over has received at least one dose and 78.4% has received two doses. \"We are considering if and how best we can \\'reward\\' those squads/players who are most Covid-compliant and who have opted to be vaccinated,\" the letter reportedly said. Former Chelsea player Tammy Abraham, who now plays for AS Roma, says he has been vaccinated.\\'A bit of confusion\\'The England national team is involved in a World Cup qualifying game against Andorra on Saturday and ahead of that match Tammy Abraham, who plays for Italian club Roma, became the first England player to confirm he had taken the Covid-19 vaccine. England manager Gareth Southgate, speaking ahead of the Andorra game, said some of players were \"more open to some of these conspiracy theories\" surround Covid-19 vaccines \"because they are reading social media more, they are perhaps more vulnerable to those sort of views.\"  \"From what I can see there is a bit of confusion around. And there are several different threads there to why they are choosing to be jabbed or not to speak publicly about it,\" Southgate told reporters.  CNN has learnt that the 20 clubs provide the Premier League with their vaccine data on the condition it doesn\\'t share it, and to help the league provide guidance on updated Covid restrictions at training facilities should clubs reach certain vaccination rates. The Premier League\\'s stance is to encourage everyone to receive the vaccine. \"As I\\'ve said all along, I don\\'t see a better way of getting through the pandemic than a vaccination programme,\" England coach Gareth Southgate said ahead of the World Cup qualifier against Andorra.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recently told reporters that \"99%\" of his squad had been vaccinated and expressed frustration at the apparent slow uptake at rival teams, saying that refusing to take the vaccine \"is a little bit like drink-driving.\" \"We all probably were in a situation where we had a beer or two and thought we still could drive but, [because of] the law, we are not allowed to drive so we don\\'t drive,\" said Klopp. \"But this law is not there for protecting me when I drink two beers and want to drive, it\\'s for protecting all the other people because I\\'m drunk and we accept that as a law. \"I don\\'t take the vaccination only to protect me, I take the vaccination to protect all the people around me. I don\\'t understand why that is a limitation of freedom because, if it is, then not being allowed to drink and drive is a limitation of freedom as well. \"I got the vaccination because I was concerned about myself but even more so about everybody around me. If I get [Covid] and I suffer from it -- my fault. If I get it and spread it to someone else -- my fault and not their fault.\" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said by refusing to be vaccinated you  endanger others.US sport leaguesSky Sports News reported last week the Wolves squad was also fully vaccinated and Brentford and Leeds had more than 90% of their players fully vaccinated. CNN contacted several leading Premier League clubs to ask about their current vaccine status, including Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Leicester City. Chelsea, Tottenham and Leicester declined to comment, while Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United hadn\\'t responded at the time of publication. In August, Southgate said he had received abuse for appearing in a video encouraging young people to get vaccinated. \"I\\'m not going to get too involved in this because I was asked to do a video supporting the vaccination programme, which I thought was responsible,\" said Southgate.\"And of all the things I received abuse for over the summer of which there\\'s been several, that\\'s probably the one I\\'ve received the most abuse over. \"I\\'m probably going to keep out of that argument for the time being.\" Andrew Wiggins #22 of the Golden State Warriors handles the ball against Brandon Clarke #15 of the Memphis Grizzlies during the second half at FedExForum on March 19, 2021 in Memphis, Tennessee. Wiggins recently received a vaccine after initially requesting exemption on religious grounds.While Roma forward Abraham confirmed he had had the vaccine, AC Milan defender Fikayo Tomori, who used to play for Chelsea and is a a member of the England squad, declined to tell reporters whether he had been vaccinated earlier this week. \"We\\'re public figures, so I definitely see why people are wondering or asking: \\'If they\\'re going to take it, I\\'m going to take it. If they\\'re not going to take it, I\\'m not going to take it\\',\" Tomori told reporters.  \"I don\\'t think it\\'s my place to put it out there if I\\'ve done this or done that to influence people. It\\'s to leave people to their own if they want to do it or not.\" Across the Atlantic, US sports leagues have been disclosing player vaccination rates. In the NHL -- which has close to a 100% vaccination rate among players -- and the NBA, unvaccinated players can be docked pay for matches or practices they miss due to failing to comply with local health authorities requiring vaccinations. Meanwhile Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving will be allowed to practice at the team\\'s facility in New York City, but won\\'t be able to play in Nets\\' home games at Barclays Center because of the city\\'s vaccine mandate, a City Hall official told CNN on Friday.Andrew Wiggins of the Golden State Warriors recently received a vaccine after initially requesting exemption on religious grounds, head coach Steve Kerr said.

              " ' (CNN)Stephanie Labbe is smiling.Swedish striker Kosovare Asllani has just placed the ball on the spot to take the first kick of a penalty shootout to decide the gold medal match of the women\\'s 2020 Olympic soccer final. Amidst the sweltering Tokyo heat, two hours of play could not separate Sweden and Canada -- now, a lifetime of training and dreams hinges on 10 spot-kicks. It\\'s about as pressurized as it gets for a footballer and yet, 12 yards away, Canadian goalkeeper Labbe is smiling.Two days later, Olympic gold medalist and penalty shootout hero Labbe isn\\'t smiling.Read MoreShe lies in a dark room. She has spent most of the previous 48 hours there.Overstimulated and feeling \"completely dissociated\" from her victory, she cannot process any of the thousands of congratulatory messages and media enquiries blowing up her phone in the wake of Canada\\'s historic triumph -- the country\\'s  first ever Olympic gold in the women\\'s soccer event.To understand her numbness following the achievement of a lifelong dream, Labbe takes us back to the first game of the tournament against hosts Japan.Canada\\'s Stephanie Labbe saves Brazilian Rafaelle\\'s penalty during the women\\'s quarterfinal shootout at the Tokyo Olympics.OverflowDuring the first-half, Labbe sustained a painful rib injury. Prophetically, she proceeded to save a penalty before -- unable to continue -- she was substituted.Unbeknownst to Labbe, the injury would dredge and then stir up a whirlpool of anxieties and mental baggage that had built up across the preceding 18 months -- the insecurity of her position on the national team, the postponing of the Olympics, a new national team coach, and the inability to train as a team for a long period.Labbe receives medical treatment during the match against Japan.\"I don\\'t think I realized at the time how much I was holding onto, how much the challenges of the past year and a half had affected me and were still underlying there in my system -- getting to the Olympics wasn\\'t just a magical cure for all of this.\" Labbe told CNN.\"That takes a toll over time and sometimes we don\\'t always see or feel what that toll is until something comes in and kind of shakes it up a bit.\"That\\'s what that injury did ... it was like the water was almost getting to the brim. I felt good and confident but just that one extra thing is what spilt it over.\"Despite the ongoing pain of her injury and a number of trips to the hospital, Labbe and her team agreed she was physically fit to continue. She missed the following match against Chile but returned to the line-up for the final group fixture against Great Britain. READ: Nadia Nadim: \\'I\\'m actually the picture of everything the Taliban don\\'t want their women to be\\'However, unseen wounds were making it a war on two fronts.\"My adrenaline was so heightened, and my neuromuscular system was so finely tuned that I struggled to come down between games, which resulted in high levels of anxiety and multiple panic attacks,\" said Labbe.\"I knew it had nothing to do with performance anxiety, I was fully confident and nerves were not an issue on matchday. It was the second that whistle blew, that moment where I had to come down and relax a bit before the next game.\"Labbe was so overstimulated that she did not train between the quarterfinal and the finals -- a fact made all the more astonishing by the back-to-back clean sheets she kept against Brazil and tournament favorites the United States en route to the final. For Labbe the pitch is her \"happy zone\", a \"release.\"Years of meticulous training, work with a sports psychologist, meditation and other mindfulness exercises have helped to forge an athlete with laser focus on matchday -- present and supremely confident.JUST WATCHED\\'Humility over hubris\\': See the most heartwarming moments from Tokyo 2020 ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\\'Humility over hubris\\': See the most heartwarming moments from Tokyo 2020  02:17National Minister of Defence So as penalties in the gold medal match loomed, Labbe looked like the most relaxed goalkeeper in the history of penalty shoot-outs.\"For me, I really was enjoying the moment,\" Labbe said.\"I remember as soon as the whistle went, I knew that the players on my team were going to feel a little bit of that stress and pressure, knowing that they were going to be stepping up to take shots.\"So as an older, more experienced player on the team, as a leader on the team, I wanted to do whatever I could to give them confidence and calmness to try to take that pressure off of them.\"I know how much body language can have an affect on people so I remember walking into that huddle and I was like, \\'Steph, smile, look relaxed, look super confident so that if anyone is a bit nervous and they look up and they see you, they\\'re gonna see you being confident and you showing this relaxed, composed version of yourself.\\'\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videosPart of the smiling demeanor, Labbe admits, was also to project pressure onto the Swedish takers. And yet, beyond a functional purpose to both ease and amplify anxiety, her grin also came from a genuine place of joy.\"I remember telling myself, \\'Steph you\\'re in a shootout to win a gold medal, at worst case you have an Olympic silver medal, you\\'ve already achieved so much and now is the time just to enjoy this,\\' Labbe said.\"You\\'re not going to get this moment back, you\\'re not going to get this opportunity again.  It might be the same but it might look a bit different, feel a little bit different, so just enjoy it.\\'\"I remember taking that time to be completely present, because what an amazing moment that was for me personally, for our team. We had made history already just going into that shootout so there was this sense of calmness because I was just enjoying it and happy to be there.\"The smiling worked. Labbe saved two penalties, Sweden failing to hit the target with two more, as Canada triumphed 3-2 in the shootout to spark euphoric scenes on the pitch of the International Stadium Yokohama. Labbe saved two penalties during the shootout against Sweden.Labbe\\'s Wikipedia biography was swiftly edited -- changing her position from goalkeeper to National Minister of Defence -- leading Canada\\'s actual Defence Minister, Harjit Sajjan, to recognize Labbe\\'s heroics. \"From one MND to another, thank you for defending the flag and for helping bring home this long awaited gold to Canada!\" Sajjan tweeted.\\'Come down\\'Yet, like the thousands of similar messages of congratulations, it would be a little while before they truly sunk in for Labbe.\"In the first 48 hours when we were still in Tokyo, that was a challenge for me because I still wasn\\'t able to come down,\" Labbe explained.\"Mental illness is just like any other injury -- you just don\\'t see it but it\\'s the same in the sense that things don\\'t just heal overnight, or with the snap of a finger.\"Just because the game was over and we won doesn\\'t mean that all of this anxiety and internal turmoil that I was going through just goes right away. \"I was waiting for that kind of release and it didn\\'t come so that\\'s why I was just so overstimulated and I needed to be in a dark room to let my mind relax, to let my body come down a bit from the high.Labbe kisses her Olympic gold medal, Canada\\'s first ever in women\\'s soccer.\"It\\'s definitely a day-by-day thing and even now, I look at the medal and I\\'m like, \\'is this really mine? Did we actually win a gold medal?\\' I don\\'t know if it fully sunk in and I don\\'t know when it actually will fully sink in.\"Labbe\\'s healing process began upon her return to Canada. Days camping away with her partner and Canadian cycling Olympian, Georgia Simmerling, allowed her to \"decompress\" and continue what would ultimately become the summer of a lifetime.DecompressionAs fall beckoned, Labbe was an Olympic gold medalist, a fianc챕, and preparing for a move to a new country -- having signed with one of the world\\'s biggest clubs, Paris Saint-Germain. \"I took a few days with my partner to go away camping, unplug for a bit and decompress,\" Labbe said.\"That was super helpful. I think not having to talk about it a lot, being able to just go through my self-healing process and then when I finally reconnected with my friends and family that\\'s when it started to really hit.\"Since then, day-by-day, talking to different people, talking about my experience and just seeing the impact that we\\'ve had on our country is really amazing. I feel so honored and proud to have been a part of that and to have done it with some of the most incredible people I\\'ve ever met.\"        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by ?뱼?벥?벍?벞?벑?벆?벜?벒?벍 ?뱵?벆?벇?벇?벍?

Kurz said Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg would become the new chancellor, according to public broadcaster ORF.Positive media coverage Read MoreKurz is under investigation over claims that government money was used to ensure positive coverage in a daily newspaper, Austrian prosecutors announced Wednesday.The chancellor, along with nine other individuals and three organizations, is under investigation over the case, according to a statement from the Office of Austria\\'s Attorney General for Economic Affairs and Corruption (WKStA) published Wednesday.According to the prosecutor, raids were carried out in several locations on Wednesday, including two government ministries, as part of the probe.The pandemic is stirring deep resentments in Europe. They may not be quick to healThe statement said: \"Between 2016 and at least 2018, budgetary funds from the finance ministry were used to finance exclusively party-politically motivated, sometimes manipulated surveys conducted by an opinion research company in the interest of a political party and its top management.\"The period indicated in the public prosecutor\\'s statement correlates to when Kurz took over the leadership of the Austrian People\\'s Party (횜VP), leading it into government through a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party after the 2017 legislative election.\"The survey results were published (without being declared as an advertisement) in the editorial section of an Austrian daily newspaper and other media belonging to the same group,\" the statement read, adding that \"suspected payments were made in return to the media company.\" Austrian media have identified the daily newspaper involved in the case as tabloid-format daily 횜sterreich (Austria), which has rejected the accusations and denied any wrongdoing in multiple op-eds published this week.Kurz remains party leaderThe corruption allegations against Kurz have caused a crisis in the Austrian government. Before Kurz\\'s resignation Saturday, opposition parties had threatened to bring a vote of no confidence against him in parliament on Tuesday.

              " 'London (CNN)Britain faces a critical shortage of workers, leading to fuel supply constraints, a run on petrol stations and unstacked shelves in supermarkets due to lack of staff or undelivered foodstuffs. Despite this immediate crisis affecting millions of people, \"gotcha\" questions on trans rights have become a feature of this year\\'s political party conference season, say trans advocates.On \"Today,\" last month, the BBC\\'s flagship news and current affairs radio program, presenter Justin Webb asked Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey if there should \"not be spaces where biological males cannot go,\" in reference to trans women. More than a week later, the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, was asked by the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr if it was transphobic to say only women had a cervix. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked the same question about cervixes this week by right-leaning broadcaster GB News.Both Davey and Starmer said respectful debates were needed on the matters. Johnson avoided answering the question directly, saying \"biology is very important but we\\'ve got a system now in our country for many, many years where people can change gender ... and what I absolutely passionately believe ... is everybody should be treated with dignity and respect.\" Boris Johnson\\'s Brexit choices are making Britain\\'s fuel and food shortages worseThe questions may appear to be grounded in science, but are in fact troublesome. People identify as transgender when their gender identity doesn\\'t align with what has culturally been associated with the one they were assigned at birth. This is an anathema to Britain\\'s gender-critical feminists, who argue sex is immutable, and some use descriptors, such as \"biological male,\" which is considered a slur by trans activists, to describe trans women over their concerns about trans women in women-only spaces.Read MoreMisgendering trans people is not only harmful to their mental health, but suggesting gender does not exist and that they are the sum total of the sex they were assigned at birth scrubs the existence of trans and non-binary people, say advocates.  Also, modern medicine views sex as a spectrum with many variables. Instersex people, for example, have natural variations in reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical definitions of female or male  Both UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leaderKeir Starmer have been fielding questions on trans rights.But none of these facts were conveyed in those short interviews, and instead complex questions and answers around trans rights have been boiled down to soundbites. \"The media shamefully advances this transphobic frontier, with both the right-wing press and ostensibly leftist outlets\" working to demonize trans people, Lisa Tilley, a political economist based at the University of London\\'s School of Oriental and African Studies, told CNN. \"Politicians are often either unprepared to reject the terms of this debate or they are actively advancing a transphobic political project themselves. Whatever the intentions of this harmful and exclusionary political project, the effects are to make the UK one of the most transphobic countries in the world,\" she opined.JUST WATCHEDHungary\\'s FM: We don\\'t want LGBTQI \\'activists\\' in schoolsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHungary\\'s FM: We don\\'t want LGBTQI \\'activists\\' in schools 14:25When it comes to trans rights \"polling shows that the public isn\\'t necessarily as hostile as the media, but the media [continues] to lead the conversation,\" Shon Faye, trans advocate and author of \"The Transgender Issue,\" told CNN. According to her analysis, in 2020 the Times and the Sunday Times published \"over 300 articles, almost one a day, and they were all negative.\" CNN has reached out to both newspapers for comment.In recent months, as in other parts of the world, a set of terms have been weaponized against the trans community in Britain. Similar to dog-whistle racism, where coded pejorative phrases, such as \"inner city\" or the term \"woke,\" are used as synonyms for Black and Brown people, constructions such as \"woke mobs,\" \"trans lobby,\" and \"gender ideology\" are uncritically used by columnists in print and reporters on live air as the British press parrots talking points by influential anti-trans grassroots campaigners, say trans advocates. In an essay for the Times decrying \"wokeism\" last November, Sky News presenter Trevor Phillips said: \"The greatest tragedy in all of this is that the gurus of wokedom have persuaded thousands of idealistic young people who rightly want to change the world into supporting what is actually a deeply reactionary movement. The trans activists can only realize their aim of being able to enter spaces reserved for women by erasing the female sex.\"Protesters wrapped in pride and trans pride flags sit on a wall during a trans rights demonstration outside Downing Street. The British media has created an environment where \"male violence is also displaced from the real culprits onto vulnerable transgender people, who are demonized collectively as abusers, rather than more accurately represented as victims and survivors of abuse,\" Tilley said.As the debate rages on, trans people, like many minority groups, remain economically and socially disenfranchised in the UK. Excluding fraud, trans people are twice as likely to be a victim of crime in England and Wales in the year ending March 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics. They also face years-long waits to receive gender-affirming care at NHS gender identity clinics and are more likely to report healthcare discrimination, domestic violence and homelessness. Culture warsTrans-critical rhetoric has real-world impact for Britain\\'s trans and queer communities especially at a time when UK\\'s government has leaned into the culture wars debate in a bid to appeal to its traditional Conservative Party base and new working-class voters in northern England.  Since Johnson came to power, his Women and Equalities ministry has stalled on a number of initiatives for the country\\'s LGBTQ community. In September 2020, Liz Truss, the Minister of Women and Equalities, said plans to make it easier for trans people to change their gender via a simplified self-declaratory system would be scrapped.This March, three members of the government\\'s LGBT Advisory Panel resigned. In his resignation letter, Scottish trans equalities campaigner James Morton said the government did not \"have any desire to build a country in which trans people are among those free to live their lives.\" Culture wars give Boris Johnson and his government a quick and easy high. They\\'re no substitute for governingThe final straw was the government\\'s \"war on woke,\" which disparaged the trans community, as well as the stalled ban on conversion therapy -- following objections to it by religious organizations, gender-critical feminists and anti-trans groups, Morton told CNN. Similar to some US Republican Party lawmakers\\' critiques of critical race theory, \"war on woke\" has turned into a catchall to describe what Conservatives don\\'t like: be it the perceived excesses of the left, conversations around racial equality, or social justice initiatives like trans rights.  In a statement to CNN, an Equalities ministry spokesperson said: \"we have repeatedly confirmed we will be banning the abhorrent practice of conversion therapy, and will be launching a consultation on our proposals shortly.\" The spokesperson added that the government has made it \"simpler for applicants\" to change their gender -- which includes cutting the application fee down to 짙5 ($6), and working on moving the process online. Carrie Johnson, wife of Britain\\'s Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaks at the annual LGBT+ pride reception hosted in partnership with Stonewall, on the third day of the annual Conservative Party Conference in Manchester in October.Conservative lawmaker Crispin Blunt, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Global LGBT+ Rights, last year called for Truss\\'s Women and Equalities brief be passed to someone else, saying she lacked \"the time or necessary empathy to continue in this role.\"Speaking to CNN, he explained her other brief (which she held before a cabinet reshuffle in September)  as \"the most important trade minister in the history of the United Kingdom\" meant she did not have bandwidth to see the gay conversion ban through. When it comes to trans issues, \"the Prime Minister quite rightly wants the temperature to be taken down on this debate, have a sensible, evidence-based conversation,\" Blunt told CNN. These sentiments were on display at a LGBT Conservatives event at the Conservative Party conference, where Johnson\\'s wife, Carrie, shared a stage with pro-trans voices in the party. There she said her husband was committed to protecting LGBTQ rights, and the government \"is banning\" conversion therapy.  While \"there are perfectly reasonably concerns of what the implication of trans women might be for women\\'s rights, a lot of that anxiety is based on wildly exaggerated theoretical positions rather than practical ones,\" Blunt told CNN. \"While [trans people] have to cope with the practical reality that it is bloody tough being trans.\"Turn the dialDespite those supportive words, the trans-critical dial in the media is up at full blast. It began in 2017 over former UK Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s plans to reform the process it takes for trans people to change their legal gender -- in line with some other European countries. \"A group of anti-trans campaigners came forward, saying they were concerned such reforms would lead to cis-men entering women\\'s spaces,\" Jane Fae, chair of Trans Media Watch, told CNN of hypothetical concerns that have yet to materialize in countries that have these rights in place.  Liz Truss, the Minister of Women and Equalities, scrapped plans to make it easier for trans people to change their gender via a simplified self-declaratory systemThe debate around reforming the law led to a surge of intolerant media coverage. \"In the four years since I cannot think of a single aspect of trans life -- from sport to ability to live in public, to access to medical treatment -- that has not come under scrutiny and attack from these people,\" she said.A 2019 study by linguist Paul Baker, a professor at Lancaster University, found the British press wrote more than 6,000 articles about trans people between 2018-19, many of them written \"in order to be critical of trans people\" and painted \"trans people as unreasonable and aggressive,\" the report wrote.  The disproportionality of the trans-critical articles for a community estimated to amount to under 1% of the British population indicates an overreaction. Despite there never having been a \"trans member of Parliament (MP),\" and close to zero trans editors or staff writers at [British] newspapers an idea has stuck that there is an influential trans \"lobby behind the scene ... and that is very much characteristic of a moral panic,\"  author Faye said.  How a US group with links to the far-right may have influenced a crackdown on Ghana\\'s LGBTQ community  It\\'s a landscape that has not gone unnoticed abroad. At the end of September, the Council of Europe\\'s Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination likened the UK\\'s record on LGBTQ rights to Russia, Turkey, Hungary and Poland -- countries with appalling track records on minority issues. The report pointed out that in England and Wales \"trans rights organisations have faced vitriolic media campaigns, in which trans women especially are vilified and misrepresented.\"Better political leadership is needed to counter the media narrative that trans people, particularly trans women, are taking resources away from cisgender women, Faye said. A leader who is willing to tackle the more complex parts of the trans debate, such as the issues surrounding access to gender-based violence services, by promising better resourcing and funds to counter the Conservative Party\\'s austerity cuts on women\\'s refuges, she added.War of wordsThe pitched battle between trans advocates and gender-critical feminists is taking place in an environment where language is changing to accommodate diverse identities, and one with which politicians and British journalists appear to struggle to keep up.The furor over whether women have a cervix related to an internal party dispute over a Labour lawmaker, Rosie Duffield, who incorrectly stated that only women had a lower uterus. She made her comment in response to a tweet by CNN -- which relayed guidance by American Cancer Society that called on \"individuals with a cervix\" to begin cervical screening.  Not every woman has a cervix. As many as 5% of reproductive-age women worldwide were born with an underdeveloped or non-existent uterus and vagina, according to Penn Medicine, and trans men can also have a cervix. Despite this evidence, which appears to be acknowledged by Britain\\'s public health service, UK\\'s Health Secretary Sajid Javid asserted as a \"total denial of scientific fact\" a comment by Labour leader Starmer that it was \"not right\" to say only women have a cervix.  Transgender people and their supporters protest outside Downing Street in August.Problems can arise when supportive cisgender people, or corporate entities, make poor linguistic and aesthetic choices when attempting to use inclusive language for non-binary, transgender and intersex people, Faye said. This happened at the end of September, when British medical journal The Lancet featured the words \"bodies with vaginas\" on the cover of its latest issue. The journal later apologized for conveying \"the impression that we have dehumanized and marginalized women,\" after the wording was widely criticized. These constructions are instead blamed by trans-critical commentators on trans people and the culture war, when perhaps there should be a better discussion about language choices, Faye said. \"Is it dehumanizing? Does it express the point? Does it include everyone? Is there a more tidy way to phrase it?\" Like clockwork, The Lancet\\'s choice of words turned into another media talking point on trans people\\'s rights. Eastern Europe was once a world leader on gay rights. Then it ran out of scapegoatsDuring the Labour conference in the southern English coastal city of Brighton last week, BBC\\'s Nick Robinson pushed Labour lawmaker David Lammy on his position on trans rights. Robinson asserted that an internal party analysis found that Labour lost working-class voters in northern England because the voters \"feel they have little in common with the young quinoa-eating graduate city-dwelling socially liberal Remainers and Labour voters who they believe do not put Britain first and judge people like them harshly and unfairly for their views.\"\"And I put it to you that those people believe that women are people who have vaginas not people who are described as \\'bodies with vaginas.\\' And that the Labour Party needs to be clear about this,\" Robinson said on \"Today.\"\"Nick, you could be asking me about climate change. You could be asking me about mental health. You could be asking me about education. You could be asking me about health. You deliberately are asking me about an issue that you know does not come up on the doorstep,\" Lammy replied. \"[You] are choosing to land on this subject that most British people are not talking about in a fuel crisis,\" Lammy added. \"And spend minutes on this, because it keeps Labour talking about identity issues and not about the substantive policies.\"',\n",

The boxers fought out a 12-round controversial split decision draw -- in which Fury was knocked down twice but managed to regain his footing -- a decision the crowd booed, meaning Wilder retained his WBC title and both fighters stayed undefeated.

The people charged in the indictment received about $2.5 million in fraudulent proceeds, prosecutors said in the indictment. US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Audrey Strauss said at a press conference Thursday the FBI arrested 16 of the defendants, including Terrence Williams, who she called the \"leader of the conspiracy.\" CNN has reached out to Williams for comment. Read MoreStrauss said Williams allegedly obtained fraudulent medical and dental invoices, sent those invoices to his co-conspirators, who then submitted the claims to the plan, which paid \"most\" of their claims for procedures that they never received.The alleged scheme, Strauss said, began around November 2017. In all, 19 people were indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud. Each person allegedly tried to claim between $65,000 to as much as $420,000 in fraudulent medical service reimbursements, Strauss said. She said that in many cases the people submitting the invoices were nowhere near the location where they claimed to be receiving treatments.\"Travel records, email, GPS data and other evidence shows that the defendants who purportedly received medical and dental services at a location on a particular date were often nowhere near the providers offices when the claimed services were supposedly provided,\" Strauss said.One former NBA player, Strauss said, submitted a bill for $48,000 claiming he had IV sedation and root canals and crowns on eight teeth on December 20, 2018 at an office in Beverly Hills, California. But Strauss said, on that date, travel records and even \"publicly available box scores\" show the man was actually playing professional basketball in Taiwan.

The name of the man showed up during searches in Sachsenhausen and the Moscow Military Archives,\" Will told CNN.96-year-old accused of being Nazi camp guard is deemed \\'unfit\\' for trial\"We looked at the time period where this man was stationed at and deployed to and collected all the evidence needed to pass information along to the local prosecutor\\'s office,\" he added.Will told CNN that the accusations against the defendant mean that a term of imprisonment can be expected, but said he cannot comment on the outcome of the expected sentence.Germany is racing to bring the last surviving perpetrators of Nazi war crimes -- now well into old age -- to justice.Nearly eight decades after the collapse of the Nazi regime, Will said that the potential circle of cases to bring the last surviving perpetrators of Nazi war crimes to justice is shrinking.\"As of today, there are only seven cases with local prosecutors. Just last week there were eight cases with local prosecutors. It\\'s a race against time,\" said Will.\"However, here at our central office for investigating Nazi crimes we are still assessing more cases, if they can be passed onto local prosecutors. All we can do now, is to help out with our investigations to bring those people to trial who have committed Nazi war crimes.\"',\n",

              " \" (CNN)After a truncated, pandemic-hobbled 2020, the MLB playoffs have come roaring back in full force. A wild end of September saw several teams fighting for spots in the postseason right up until the final regular season game, and some World Series favorites still catching their breath after 11th-hour playoff clinches. Now, after Chris Taylor's dramatic home run Wednesday night lifted the defending champs Los Angeles Dodgers past the St. Louis Cardinals, eight teams remain. In the American League, the Tampa Bay Rays will battle the Boston Red Sox while the Chicago White Sox face off against the Houston Astros. Over in the National League, the Atlanta Braves face the Milwaukee Brewers while the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants meet in an epic clash between archrivals with the two best records in baseball.Read MoreHere's a recap of the late-season twists and turns that got us here, and a look at the best playoff storylines.Two bitter East Coast rivals squeak into the playoffsEvery once in a precious while, 162 regular-season games just aren't enough to paint a full postseason picture. Only 16 times in MLB history have tiebreaker matchups been needed to determine division winners or wild-card spots. Fans this year were itching for some Game 163 action in the American League, which could have ended in a three- or even four-way tie for the wild card.But the Yankees and Red Sox both clinched playoff spots on the very last day of the regular season, edging the surging Toronto Blue Jays and surprising Seattle Mariners. The Boston Red Sox celebrate with champagne in their clubhouse after winning the 2021 American League wild card game against the New York Yankees.And the drama wasn't over! That set up a crucial one-and-done duel between the two most storied rivals in baseball. The Red Sox beat the Yankees, 6-2, on Tuesday before a thunderous home crowd at Fenway Park and now face the Rays, who easily won the AL East division. The Rays have their own score to settle, though: They lost last year's World Series to the Dodgers. On the West Coast, the returning champs face a resurgent dynasty The Los Angeles Dodgers are loaded with talent, won 106 games and are favorites to repeat their 2020 World Series glory. But they came very close to not even making it this far -- thanks to their divisional rivals, the San Francisco Giants, who won 107 games and snatched the NL West division title from the Dodgers on the very last day of the season. Justin Turner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He hit a crucial home run in Wednesday's wild card game.That sent the Dodgers to the NL wild-card game to face the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cards were heavy underdogs, but in a one-game playoff, anything can happen.For a while it looked like the Cardinals might hold on to an early 1-0 lead and shock the champs,  but the baseball gods would not be denied. The Dodgers tied the game, then won it with Taylor's stunning blast in the bottom of the ninth inning -- only the fifth time in MLB history that a postseason, winner-take-all game ended with a walk-off home run.Now, poetically, the Dodgers will face the Giants in the divisional round. It's safe to say they'll be looking for revenge. The Giants, meanwhile, are looking for their first World Series win since their historic 2010, 2012 and 2014 championship runs. Two teams are gunning for their first-ever titlesWhile this year's playoff field is stocked with recent World Series champs (the Dodgers won in 2020, the Red Sox in 2018 and the Astros in 2017), the Milwaukee Brewers and the Tampa Bay Rays have never tasted sweet World Series victory. Tyrone Taylor of the Milwaukee Brewers scores  during a game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on July 29, 2021.Both are small-market franchises that have been to the World Series -- the Brewers only once, in 1982 -- but have never brought home the hardware.The Atlanta Braves have something to prove here, too. Their last World Series title came in 1995, making them the team with the longest championship drought among those remaining contenders who have won rings. And the Chicago White Sox have captured only one World Series crown in the last century -- in 2005, which to their fans probably feels like ancient history.Covid-19 may have altered the playoff pictureWhile many MLB teams relaxed Covid-19 protocols in the second half of the season, the specter of the pandemic still hovers over the playoffs.Major League Baseball requested that teams in 2021 reach at least an 85% vaccination rate among their players. Several teams that failed to reach that threshold hurt their playoff chances when key players were suspended due to Covid-19.A security guard checks Covid-19 vaccination cards before a game between the Toronto Blue Jays and Miami Marlins on June 2, 2021.After a strong start to the season, for example, the Red Sox stumbled in the second half as many of their players were sidelined by positive covid tests. Boston still squeaked into the postseason, but other teams were not so lucky.Major League Baseball will require all non-playing personnel -- including managers, coaches and athletic trainers ??to be vaccinated for Covid-19 in order to gain access to the field and other restricted areas during the postseason.When it comes to fans at playoff games, MLB is leaving coronavirus protocols, such as mask requirements, up to the individual teams. \",\n",
              " ' (CNN)Not long after his transfer from Sporting to Manchester United, it quickly became apparent that Bruno Fernandes was the Premier League club\\'s most influential player.In a new study on player burnout released by players\\' union FIFPro, which represents more then 65,000 footballers worldwide, it found that the Portuguese star -- who is also an integral part of his national team -- \"became one of the most \\'overused\\' players in world football.\"Even United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted in an interview to ESPN that he maybe \"overplayed\" Fernandes -- who featured 58 times for United as it finished second in the Premier League and reached the Europa League final last season -- but insisted it was because he was \"so important for us.\"This season looks to be no different and with United still competing in three competitions, coupled with Fernandes\\' World Cup qualifying commitments for Portugal, a conservative estimate could see the 27-year-old taking part in 60 matches.But this is far from an issue that is exclusive to Fernandes and United. Read MoreThe football calendar\\'s grueling schedule and the physical and mental toll it takes on players has being the subject of much discussion for several years now.READ: World\\'s best soccer stars are playing too much, says players\\' unionBruno Fernandes played 58 games for United last season ... and could play even more this campaign.It\\'s an issue that has only been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, as leagues around the world struggled to complete truncated seasons before beginning the following campaign almost immediately.Add in the current international schedule -- which is seeing confederations cramming in more matches than ever before owing to fixture cancellations due to the pandemic -- and players at the top end of the sport are now experiencing the worst calendar congestion of their careers.\\'An obscene amount of games\\'It\\'s not only playing an inordinate numbers of minutes every week that is affecting star footballers. It\\'s also the long-haul international flights through multiple time zones, a particular problem for those traveling from Europe to South America and Asia for international duty.As of 2024, football will need a new calendar as the current format expires. However, rather than reducing the number of games to prevent players from burning out, current proposals would see footballers potentially play more matches at both club and international level.This is due to the expanded Champions League format touted by UEFA, European football\\'s governing body, that would result in an extra 100 matches per season, and the plans put forward by FIFA, world football\\'s governing body, to host a World Cup every two years instead of four.Darren Burgess, a performance coach who previously worked at Liverpool and Arsenal, recalls his time with the Gunners when trying to manage players\\' workload.\"Certainly in my role, most recently at Arsenal, where we made Europa League semifinal and then the Europa League final in consecutive years, including a Carling Cup final, we just played an obscene amount of games,\" Burgess said.While UEFA and the European Club Association (ECA) have criticized FIFA for its plans, UEFA has itself been criticized by leading officials from Europe\\'s biggest leagues over its own proposals.FIFPro says football\\'s governing bodies need to see the bigger picture when it comes to player burnout.The FIFPro report highlights Son Heung-min of South Korea as one of the players who traveled the most for international duty.\"What I think is quite interesting ... is that our arguments are always brought to the table by the other stakeholders when somebody else makes a proposal,\" FIFPro general secretary Jonas Baer Hoffmann said.\"So when do you need more Champions League games, then all of a sudden \\'well, the players are playing too much,\\' say the leagues and say FIFA. If you want a second World Cup, \\'oh, the players are playing too much,\\' says UEFA.\"Now, I guess at some point, if you hold them accountable to this argument, then you\\'re going to have to force them to hold it against themselves, too.\"Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who has been one of the leading voices for FIFA in its push for a biennial World Cup, has previously insisted they are \"very conscious\" of not increasing the number of matches for players.\"What is most important for me is more meaningful games,\" he said recently, as he outlined his \"Football for Tomorrow\" proposal. \"We want to give the fans what fans demand today, and that is meaningful games. We want to respond to that expectation.\"You have 20% national team football and 80% club football and we want to maintain that balance, but we just want to reorganise it in a more efficient way.\"This means regrouping and reducing qualifiers in national team football, creating longer periods for players to remain with their clubs and to establish a guaranteed rest period for players every year.\"\\'Simply unsustainable\\'Baer-Hoffmann was speaking at a roundtable organized by FIFPro, in which the union proposed a new plan that would see players take planned, compulsory breaks during the season to protect their physical and mental health.The proposal comes off the back of a FIFPro report that the union says shows footballers are currently playing an alarming number of minutes in what it calls the \"critical zone\" -- playing at least 45 minutes in matches that have less than five days rest between them.FIFPro says playing an excessive number of minutes in this critical zone can greatly increase a player\\'s chances of injury and even shorten their career.Depending on the regularity of these enforced breaks -- whether footballers sit out after as few as three consecutive games in the critical zone or five -- players could miss between two and eight games per season across club and international duty.While it may sound radical to many football fans, similar concepts are often applied in other sports.In the NBA, for example, where players regularly play on back-to-back nights and every other night throughout an 82-game season, franchise stars commonly have rest periods scheduled into their seasons, most commonly referred to as load management.Kawhi Leonard of the LA Clippers has been one of the NBA players to benefit most from load management.FIFPro\\'s report is based on data from about 40,000 appearances by a sample of 265 male players from 44 leagues between June 2018 and August 2021 and says these compulsory mid-season breaks will benefit players and teams in the long term.For those players that combined club and international duty, the report found that 67% of their minutes last season were played in the critical zone, up from 61% in each of the previous two seasons.In Fernandes\\' case, the midfielder never dropped below 67% between November 2020 and April 2021 and was regularly at or near 100%.\"What we see with these high workload numbers across a number of indicators, be that back-to-back [matches] or travel, that this is simply unsustainable for the player, but also for the game and for the competitions,\" Alexander Bielefeld, FIFPro Head of Global Policy, said.\"So the question is really how you smartly regulate that. The report doesn\\'t propose solutions to the regulation itself, but to assume that just smart managing and smart coaching does the trick.\"Bielefeld says that currently the \"pressure is too high\" on everybody involved in football to achieve consistently good results for them to be able to leave out star players for certain matches, but says it is crucial to start the conversation ahead of the new calendar.How would a manager or head coach react to being told their star player needs to sit out the next match? How would a fan who has traveled to Paris to watch Lionel Messi or Manchester to watch Cristiano Ronaldo react after spending hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars to watch their favorite player?Darren Burgess, (left) currently with Melbourne Football Club, was previously a high performance coach at Arsenal and Liverpool.Burgess believes real forward planning before the season has started could largely negate these issues.\"Part of my role with Mr [Arsene] Wenger and Mr [Unai] Emery, the coaches for the two seasons, were to to talk to them about that very issue, about planning and about these players,\" he said. \"Some players can play, some players can\\'t play. \"So if these rules are in place at the start of the season, then it allows the high performance coach, the doctor, the coach and the fan to understand that this is being done to promote performance and to protect the players so that you can maximize the exposure of the player to the most critical games. \"So as long as these guidelines are in place, then that does allow you to plan.\"',\n",

The dramatic developments of Ronaldo\\'s return were only amplified by the reported interest of United\\'s local rival Manchester City, but the five-time Ballon d\\'Or winner eventually signed a deal to rejoin the club he spent six years at between 2003 and 2009. HomecomingRonaldo\\'s long-awaited homecoming followed the perfect script, scoring twice on his first game back at Old Trafford as United defeated Newcastle 4-1.The 36-year-old has enjoyed a customarily productive start to the season -- scoring again in victory at West Ham before adding two goals in two games in the Champions League, including a dramatic injury time winner against Villarreal.Ronaldo celebrates his side\\'s victory against Villarreal.However, Ronaldo\\'s assured return has contrasted to an altogether stuttering start for his side and former teammate-turned-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.Having played alongside the Norwegian during his first spell in Manchester, Ronaldo now finds himself tasked with helping to ease the pressure on Solskjaer following a string of poor results. His Champions League debut, though marked with a goal, saw United fall to a shock 2-1 defeat to Swiss team Young Boys. Ronaldo\\'s following rescue act against Villareal was sandwiched between two disappointing Old Trafford displays with defeat to Aston Villa and a draw against Everton, the latter of which saw Ronaldo named on the substitute\\'s bench.Sir Alex Ferguson, the legendary former United coach of both Ronaldo and Solskjaer, said that Everton were given a boost \"when they saw Ronaldo wasn\\'t playing,\" adding that \"you should always start with your best players.\"Ronaldo\\'s second-half substitution was not enough to prevent a 1-1 draw with Everton.Asked if he regretted the decision, Solskjaer replied: \"No. You make decisions throughout a long, long season, and you\\'ve got to manage the players\\' workload.\"The decision was, for me, the correct one today.\"Having come on as a second-half substitute, Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure as he left the pitch at the end of the Everton draw, a result that saw United miss the chance to go level on points with leader Chelsea.A tale of two signingsConcerns about the club\\'s mixed start to the campaign will only be heightened by a glance at the schedule for the winter months. United faces Leicester City, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal within its next seven Premier League matches. Similarly, Ronaldo\\'s strong form has overshadowed a relatively disappointing start for fellow summer arrival Jadon Sancho. Following a sparkling four-year spell in Germany with Borussia Dortmund, the English winger\\'s long-running transfer saga finally concluded with his move to United following Euro 2020. Touted as the missing piece of the puzzle to solve the club\\'s problems at right wing, Sancho is yet to score in a United shirt.However, an encouraging second-half cameo from Sancho against Everton was a silver lining of an altogether disappointing afternoon on Saturday; Solskjaer and United will be hoping the performance was a sign of things to come from a 21-year-old with undeniable ability.

And on the island of Ireland, there is legitimate concern that the British government is about to suspend part of the Brexit deal that prevents tension between the north and south. The fuel crisis was caused by a lack of truck drivers, a situation partially due to the Brexit that Johnson campaigned for. And there is plenty of evidence that the Prime Minister could have taken decisions months ago that would have avoided many of the wider problems. Boris Johnson isn\\'t worried about the UK economy.

Rather than reflect on the pandemic, considering ways to mitigate the impact Brexit is having on the economy or worrying about the opposition Labour party capitalizing on Johnson\\'s blunders, Conservative party members appear to be making up for two years of being unable to celebrate Johnson\\'s success. And it really does feel as though it is Johnson\\'s success they are enjoying. Normally, conferences such as these focus on a series of talking points spread across government departments, showcasing the breadth of talent in the ministerial team. But this conference has really been about one thing: Johnson\\'s at times ambiguous dream of \"leveling up\" the UK, which is about bringing poorer communities in line with wealthier areas in terms of quality of life, job opportunities and more. The logic behind this is straightforward: if Johnson can make life better in areas that don\\'t have the same opportunities as some cities, most notably London, the resentment in those run-down areas toward the elite will be reduced, Johnson will be hailed a nation-unifying hero and he will tighten his grip on the UK\\'s electorate. Boris Johnson on the campaign trail in 2019, when he pledged to \"get Brexit done.\"There are questions about how the PM plans to fund his ambitions. Yes, some members of his own cabinet have been outspoken about the government\\'s idea to raise taxes in order to pay for things like social care. Others in the party, mostly traditional fiscal conservatives, are uncomfortable with the amount of state intervention and funding Johnson has seemed fine with during the pandemic. However, when these grievances are weighed against the fact that Johnson delivered the Conservative party its largest majority since the 1990s, it turns out that power at any cost apparently tastes better than losing with honor. One government minister told CNN on Monday night that \"fuel problems, food shortages, arguments over tax, all this stuff is definitely happening. But riding on his wave of success is ultimately just more fun.\" Poor oppositionCNN asked multiple government officials, including cabinet ministers, why the very real problems facing the country were not being discussed at all. Their replies all pointed to the fact that -- as they see it -- if an election were held tomorrow, Johnson would win comfortably. \"The party, the members, we are all unified around a personality who keeps winning on his own terms. It\\'s absolutely intoxicating to be part of,\" said one government official. The reasons for Johnson\\'s success are most likely down to poor opposition on numerous fronts. Boris Johnson\\'s reign is becoming one long crisisWithin his own party, he is an unrivaled king for the reasons outlined above. It\\'s very rare for any party leader to face as little public dissent as Johnson does. Even ministers who were sacked in the most recent reshuffle are full of praise for their leader. Outside the gated conference in Manchester, the official opposition Labour party has also failed to make any real capital out of the recent crises plaguing the country. Even at their own party conference last week, Labour members were more focused on internal party politics than attacking an incumbent government that has been forced to call in the army to deliver fuel. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Manchester, even offered to work with Johnson on his \"leveling up\" agenda, acknowledging that the country has suffered from far too much division following Brexit and the pandemic. The truth is, there\\'s probably very little to be gained from attacking the Prime Minister anyway.  Outside the gates in Manchester, even the numbers of anti-Conservative protestors are smaller -- and much less vocal -- than at other conferences in recent years, when British politics was deadlocked by Brexit. Out of use fuel pumps at a BP petrol station in Birmingham, England, on September 28, 2021. On Monday night, the EU Commission held a reception in the conference center. Officials who spoke to CNN commented -- with some surprise -- on how little Brexit was being discussed. \"They only seem to care about this leveling up thing,\" said one. \"Whether it\\'s a good or bad thing, they all seem to be on the same page and behind Boris.\" Earlier on Monday, Johnson\\'s bulldog-ish Brexit negotiator David Frost, had talked of unilaterally suspending the Northern Ireland Protocol in a matter of weeks. Why would anyone trust Brexit Britain again?The protocol, a key point of contention throughout the Brexit talks, was negotiated and signed with the EU by Johnson himself; it aims to eliminate the need for border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Suspending it could have wide-ranging and damaging consequences.Somewhat surprisingly, Frost was seen chatting away with European officials like old friends at the same EU Commission reception.Before the conference began, some Conservative MPs told CNN that the party needed to answer one question: Is the man who used his personality-led brand of politics to ram Brexit through, after years of deadlock, the right man to navigate the UK through years of turmoil and avoidable crises.If the past few days in Manchester are anything to go by, the answer is an unequivocal yes. Whatever is going on in the real world, Johnson retains a poll lead big enough to win an election. He holds a parliamentary majority that means he can get virtually any policy through the House of Commons. There is no one in the UK, in any political party or opposition group, who looks even close to weakening his grip on British politics any time soon. The Prime Minister\\'s sister once said that when he was a young man, Johnson wanted to be \"world king.\" He might not be that, but he\\'s currently the de facto king of British politics. And he has the means at his disposal to hold tight to that power for as long as he chooses. ',\n",

Andrew McFarlane, the UK\\'s most senior family court judge, said in his ruling on Wednesday that he found that through a network of servants and agents, Sheikh Mohammed had hacked the mobile phones of Princess Haya, her personal assistant, her solicitors Baroness Shackleton and Nicholas Manners, and two members of her personal security staff using \"Pegasus\" software licensed to Dubai and the UAE by an Israeli company. The software used included the capacity to track the target\\'s locations, listen to their telephone calls, access their contacts lists, passwords, calendars, and photographs, and read messages received through apps, emails, and SMS. McFarlane said in his ruling the \"the findings represent a total abuse of trust, and indeed an abuse of power.\" \"It is an abuse which has been compounded by the manner in which the father has contested these allegations and instructed his lawyers. Despite the weight of evidence, the fact of hacking was never conceded, nor was the fact that such hacking had been by Pegasus,\" McFarlane said.Read MorePrincess Haya, Dubai ruler\\'s wife, seeks court order to prevent child\\'s forced marriage\"At no stage has the father offered any sign of concern for the mother, who is caring for their children, on the basis that her phones have been hacked and her security infiltrated.

The judgment was released Wednesday, following a year-long reporting restriction that was lifted by the Family Division of the UK High Court. In a statement Wednesday, Sheikh Mohammed contested the judgment, saying it was based on \"an incomplete picture.\"\"I have always denied the allegations made against me and I continue to do so. These matters concern supposed operations of State security. As a Head of Government involved in private family proceedings, it was not appropriate for me to provide evidence on such sensitive matters either personally or via my advisers in a foreign court. Neither the Emirate of Dubai nor the UAE are party to these proceedings, and they did not participate in the hearing. The findings are therefore inevitably based on an incomplete picture,\" his statement said. \"In addition, the findings were based on evidence that was not disclosed to me or my advisers. I therefore maintain that they were made in a manner which was unfair,\" it continued.

In January, McFarlane and Justice Martin Chamberlain ruled that the FAS doctrine did not prevent the court from adjudicating Princess Haya\\'s claims. The findings are part of a series of ongoing hearings in London involving Princess Haya, and follow a ruling delivered in March 2020, which concluded Sheikh Mohammed had previously organized the abduction of two of his daughters and forcibly returned them to Dubai, where he held them against their will.

              " 'Rome and Paris (CNN)Pope Francis on Wednesday called a report detailing decades of abuse in the French Catholic Church \"a moment of shame,\" and called upon leaders of the Church to ensure \"similar tragedies\" never happen again. Francis was speaking a day after a landmark report found that members of the Catholic clergy in France sexually abused an estimated 216,000 minors over the past seven decades and that the Church prioritized the protection of the institution over survivors who were urged to stay silent. The number of abused minors rises to an estimated 330,000 when including victims of people who were not clergy but had other links to the Church, such as Catholic schools and youth programs. The damning French report follows similar investigations in other countries that have dealt a blow to the reputation of the Catholic Church in recent years. In his weekly remarks at the Vatican on Wednesday morning, the Pope expressed his shame that the Church has ignored sexual abuse victims for too long, saying that he wants the Church to be a \"safe home for everyone.\"Read MoreThe Pope did not directly address allegations of ongoing abuse in his Wednesday comments. However, he encouraged bishops and Church leaders to \"continue to make every effort to ensure that similar tragedies do not happen again.\"\"I express closeness and paternal support to the priests of France in the face of this evidence,\" he said, adding: \"It is hard. But is it healthy.\"Pope Francis holds his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Wednesday.Francis also assured sexual abuse survivors of his prayers and said: \"I wish to express my sorrow and my pain to the victims for the trauma that they have suffered and also my shame, our shame, my shame for the too long incapacity of the church to put them at the center of its attention.\"The report said that \"the Catholic Church is the place where the prevalence of sexual violence is at its highest, other than in family and friend circles.\" It found that children were also more likely to abused within Church settings than in state-run schools or summer camps.Jean-Marc Sauv챕, the president of the Independent Commission on Sexual Abuse in the Church (CIASE) which authored the report, said Tuesday that while most of the violence happened between 1950 and 1968, it still persists today. Abuse of minors within the Church accounts for close to 4% of all sexual violence in France, according to Sauv챕. \"The problem is not behind us, it is still here,\" he said.More than 200,000 children sexually abused by French Catholic clergy, damning report findsBetween 2,900 and 3,200 abusers were estimated to have worked in the French Catholic Church between 1950 and 2020, out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics, according to the report.And while the Church has taken \"important steps\" to prevent sexual violence in recent years, the report described them as reactive and insufficient, warning that although \"these acts of violence were in decline up until the early 1990s, they have since stopped decreasing.More than half the abuses detailed in the report occurred before 1969, when the Church in France ignored abuse by people it put in power, according to Sauv챕.\"This first period ... is marked by absolutely total indifference of the Church towards victims. The suffering of victims, the harm (suffered by) victims, the trauma of victims, in fact, does not exist,\" Sauv챕 told CNN.Over 70 years, \"the Church\\'s attitude could be summarized as one of concealment, relativization or even denial, with only a very recent recognition dating from 2015, and even then, unequally accepted by dioceses and religious institutions,\" the report said.CNN\\'s Simon Bouvier and Sam Bradpiece contributed reporting.

Few have done so while still playing.But it\\'s not just football stars who worry about acceptance within their world -- it\\'s fans, too.If Wales qualify for the 2022 World Cup, it will be a dream come true for James Brinning.As a longstanding fan of the national team, Brinning would like nothing more than to see Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and company make it to international football\\'s biggest tournament. But if The Dragons do find themselves on the world stage next year, for the first time in more than sixty years, then Brinning faces the possibility of not being able to travel to watch any of the team\\'s matches in person -- not because of any coronavirus restrictions but because he is gay and this World Cup is due to be held in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison.Read More\"To be able to watch Wales play at the World Cup would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" Brinning told CNN Sport. \"But, honestly, I just don\\'t know if I\\'d be able to go because I wouldn\\'t feel safe. And that\\'s really upsetting to think about -- because I should be able to be a part of such a huge moment in Welsh football history if it happens.\"In July, Qatar World Cup organizers told CNN that it will not stop anybody from entering the country based on \"sexual orientation,\" or indeed any other aspect, including their \"race, religion, creed.\"\"This World Cup is open for everybody.\" Germany fans hold up signs in relation to LGBTQ+ rights during the UEFA Euro 2020 round of 16 match at Wembley Stadium, LondonHowever the decision made by FIFA to host the tournament in a nation where LGBTQ+ fans potentially do not feel welcome is just one aspect of a wider problem facing football right now, in which LGBTQ+ supporters feel that homophobia is on the rise within the sport and the ruling bodies of the game aren\\'t doing enough to address it.In a statement to CNN, a FIFA spokesperson said: \"As laid out in the FIFA World Cup Sustainability Strategy, Qatar as a host country is fully aware of its responsibility to adhere to FIFA\\'s expectations and requirements on human rights, equality and non-discrimination.\"\"Qatar is committed to ensuring that everyone will be able to enjoy the tournament in a safe and welcoming environment, to building bridges of cultural understanding and to creating an inclusive experience for all participants, attendees and local communities, including from the LGBTIQ+ community,\" the spokesperson added. \"FIFA is confident that all necessary measures will be in place for LGBTIQ+ fans and allies to enjoy the tournament in a welcoming and safe environment, just as everyone else.\"Brinning\\'s concerns are not just limited to football\\'s most prestigious occasion.LGBTQ+ fans, he says, find themselves often having to research what the attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people are in particular nations when events such as the Euros, the Europa League and the Champions League are held before they travel overseas to support their teams -- just to know if they\\'ll be safe to step foot in stadiums.In the UK, Brinning also points to the deeply disheartening experience of hearing homophobic chants sung by fellow fans of the same club.\"I remember watching Spurs [Tottenham Hotspur] play Chelsea in the FA Cup and I was so excited,\" recalled Brinning. \"And then, that familiar \\'Rent Boy\\' chant came about and I was so disappointed, not just because I had to listen to homophobic language -- but because it was coming from other Spurs fans. \"It just takes away from the camaraderie that you\\'re supposed to share with your fellow fans.\"The chant Brinning refers to is a derogatory song that\\'s deemed deeply offensive to the LGBTQ+ community and which has been used for years to mock Chelsea.In a statement on the subject of discriminatory abuse at the start of the new season, Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters said: \"I think we\\'ve made it very clear that tackling discrimination is a priority for the Premier League, and so have all of our clubs.\"We\\'ve introduced a league-wide ban, so if you are caught then you\\'ll be banned from not just your own club but all other Premier League clubs as well [...] and with fans coming back, we\\'re working with stewards to help them to deal with some of these issues should they arise.\"Masters also said that the Premier League are \"working with fan groups, with fans, to help fund some fan education so people can fully understand the impact of discriminatory abuse.\"Under the Football Offenses Act -- first introduced in the UK in 1991 -- there is no mention of homophobic chanting or the use of homophobic language in stadiums as offenses. Even under the section of the Act that deems it an offense to engage in chanting of an \\'incident\\' nature, there is no specific reference to homophobic language or homophobia as \\'indecent\\' behavior.Are football\\'s ruling bodies really trying to eradicate homophobia?In August, the Professional Footballers\\' Association -- a union for former and current footballers across English leagues -- released an analysis of online abuse aimed at football players between September 2020 and May 2021. It found that almost a third of all abuse directed towards players was homophobic.In December 2020, this particular kind of abuse reached a peak -- in the same month that the Rainbow Laces campaign, dedicated to showing support for the LGBTQ+ community across sport, runs throughout English football. Stonewall\\'s rainbow laces campaign runs through the month of DecemberThe PFA analysis came just a month after Euro 2020 drew to a close -- a competition that, for all the joy it brought, also served as a site of discrimination towards LGBTQ+ football fans at times, too. On June 23, Germany faced Hungary in a game that was coated in an atmosphere of tension and deep discomfort as LGBTQ+ activists made clear their concerns about not feeling especially welcome at the clash. Ahead of the match, LGBTQ+ fans, allies and German officials, including the Munich mayor Dieter Reiter, had made a request to UEFA -- the governing body for European football -- for permission to light up the Allianz Arena in rainbow colors.The request was made in solidarity with Hungary\\'s LGBTQ+ community, following the introduction in the summer of legislation in the country that banned any material in schools that authorities believe to be guilty of \\'promoting\\' homosexuality or gender-change. The legislation is one of a string of divisive policies championed by Hungarian leader Victor Orban, a hardline nationalist who has previously railed against LGBTQ people and immigrants. \"It\\'s not about homosexuals, it\\'s about the kids and the parents,\" said Orban in June of the legislation.\"UEFA declined Reiter\\'s request and issued a statement claiming that the decision was due to its \\'political context,\\' as it reminded the world that the body itself is a \\'politically and religiously neutral organization.\\'But UEFA\\'s refusal to allow an act as benign as lighting up a stadium with the colors of the rainbow flag not only left a number of LGBTQ+ football fans feeling pushed aside and dismissed -- it also further raised the question as to what exactly football\\'s governing bodies are doing to protect and empower lovers of the game who aren\\'t heterosexual or cisgender. Fans wearing the rainbow flag outside of the Allianz Arena at Euro 2020All of this has led LGBTQ+ football fans, clubs, and players to ask: Does the footballing world care about eradicating homophobia from the game?Lou Englefield, Director of Pride Sports and a key leader in the global Football v Homophobia campaign, thinks there is much more that football\\'s governing bodies could be doing to combat this kind of discrimination.\"This year, UEFA licensed the European Championship [the Euros] in countries that prohibit LGBTQ+ displays of pride and solidarity,\" she told CNN Sport.\"And then they didn\\'t stand by the community when they needed to and they allowed nations which are fostering increasingly homophobic sentiment to run riot. And this actually directly opposed UEFA\\'s principles of protecting and upholding human rights.\" Englefield points out that there is a question reverberating amongst LGBTQ+ football supporters as to whether or not they actually have a voice in the governance of the sport -- as their concerns about the presence of hostility and homophobia across the game so often go unaddressed:\"Ahead of the Euros, for example, several LGBTQ+ football organizations and initiatives put forward a letter to UEFA to express our worries about the homophobic rhetoric and environments that could be found in some of the host nations,\" Englefield said. \"And we never received a reply. To this day, we still haven\\'t received any acknowledgment of the letter.\" Counter-protesters chant during the annual Pride parade in Budapest, Hungary in June, 2021CNN has reached out to UEFA for comment but did not receive a response.To Englefield, UEFA\\'s lack of response to this letter indicates a \"failure\" on their part to protect LGBTQ+ fans.\"We know that there are complications when it comes to hosting major footballing events in nations with their own legislation and attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights,\" she said.\"But there are ways to deal with the state-sanctioned homophobia that some nations perpetuate -- and UEFA did not deal with this well during Euro 2020. Not at all.\"As for the ways to deal with the task of ensuring LGBTQ+ football fans feel safe and welcome at matches held in environments that are home to stringent homophobia, Englefield is quick to suggest what UEFA and FIFA could and should do.\"When the last World Cup was held in Russia, for example, FARE -- the anti-discrimination network for football in Europe and further afield -- used two venues, one in St Petersburg and one in Moscow, called \\'Diversity Houses,\\' she explained.\"And those houses held workshops and showed informative films intended to encourage solidarity with LGBTQ+ people and to raise awareness of the plight that LGBTQ+ people so often face in Russia.\"\"This was such an impactful way of providing support for LGBTQ+ football fans -- it didn\\'t require us to boycott the tournament but, instead, it established safe spaces for us and encouraged others to learn more about our community, our struggles and our pride,\" she said.\"It allowed us to use the tournament to highlight the fact that LGBTQ+ people exist in football and to encourage allyship.\"Englefield was disappointed that, when Euro 2020 matches were held in nations where homophobic sentiment can be found in almost every corner, there were no similar \\'Diversity Houses\\' or initiatives designed to support LGBTQ+ football fans established by UEFA.\\'Football has to evolve to include minorities -- or the game will die\\'Rory Magrath is a Professor of Sociology at Solent University, in Southampton, whose work revolves around LGBTQ+ identity in football, acceptance of homosexuality amongst football fans, anti-discrimination policy, and sports media representation. \"While there has been an increase in LGBTQ+ visibility in football over the past decade, as Rainbow Laces has taken off and as prominent players such as Harry Kane and Jordan Henderson wear rainbow armbands during Pride month -- it still isn\\'t enough,\" Magrath said\"The Rainbow Laces campaign only lasts for a few weeks at the start of the season, so what then? Players aren\\'t wearing rainbow armbands all year round. What happens to visibility for LGBTQ+ football fans when it isn\\'t Pride?\"Liverpool\\'s Jordan Henderson wears a rainbow coloured captain\\'s armband in support of the Rainbow Laces campaign during a matchMagrath thinks more should be done to combat homophobia in the sport at all times of the year, not just when we celebrate the community in certain months.He says that the problem lies in part with another of football\\'s major governing bodies, too and its tendency to \"react\" to social issues, rather than take the lead on them.\"The FA [the Football Association -- responsible for overseeing English football] are typically reactive rather than proactive when it comes to confronting homophobia,\" Magrath told CNN Sport.\"While we have seen increased visibility in recent years, it\\'s come as a result of external pressure and campaigns by LGBTQ+ supporters groups led by fans of clubs that the FA have responded to -- rather than internal initiative.\" In a statement, an FA spokesperson told CNN:\"The FA stands firmly against all forms of prejudice and we\\'re committed to tackling homophobia, biphobia and transphobia at every level of English football [...] we\\'re striving to ensure that football at all levels is a welcoming, inclusive and safe environment for all.\"The FA also specifically referenced the subject of LGBTQ+ visibility at Euro 2020.\"We believe that role models and allies are key to increased visibility and we were proud to stand in allyship with LGBTQ+ communities around the world during England\\'s UEFA EURO 2020 fixture against Germany this summer,\" the statement read.\"We welcome the Pride flag at all England fixtures at Wembley Stadium and continue to show support for the Three Lions Pride supporters group, while delivering role model and allyship programmes for our employees, in partnership with Stonewall.\"Away from English football Magrath thinks that, in choosing to host major competitions in nations that punish same-sex relationships and acts, FIFA and UEFA are sending mixed messages to LGBTQ+ football fans. \"On the one hand, fans see prominent players wearing rainbow armbands which makes them think there\\'s a place for them in football,\" Magrath said. \"And, on the other hand, the next World Cup is being held in Qatar -- where LGBTQ+ fans know they face consequences if they express themselves in public while they\\'re there.\"England\\'s Harry Kane wears an rainbow armband during a Euro 2020 matchMagrath feels that UEFA and FIFA fail to properly stand in solidarity with LGBTQ+ football fans by arguing, as they did during the Euro 2020 match between Germany and Hungary, that they don\\'t want to be part of any \"political acts or statement\" -- allowing them to avoid taking major action on the state-sanctioned homophobia seeping its way into football.\"When they don\\'t put on displays of support for the community, such as in their refusal to light up the Allianz Arena in rainbow colors, they\\'re trying to depoliticize football,\" Magrath said. \"As if there\\'s never been any politics in sports ever before!\"Across his research Magrath has found that, while many LGBTQ+ fans feel that football is becoming inclusive, almost all of the ones he spoke to still don\\'t think that football is a welcoming space for them. And, as the sport\\'s most influential governing bodies are accused of failing to show support for the community when it is needed the most, homophobia continues to course through the beautiful game. \"Fans still feel that they have to display a heteromasculine demeanor to fit in,\" Magrath claimed. \"Despite positive shifts in attitudes we\\'ve seen over the past few years, there\\'s a disparity between perceptions of LGBTQ+ visibility in football and the experiences of fans themselves.\"As the most powerful institutions in football are met with suggestions that they are indifferent to the homophobia that so clearly exists within the sport, Magrath warns that -- unless serious action to tackle the problem is taken -- the game is at risk of fizzling out in the future. \"Football has to evolve to include minorities and LGBTQ+ fans -- if it doesn\\'t, it loses those fans forever, and it excludes a great number of people,\" Magrath said.\"If we don\\'t improve the culture in football to make it a safe space -- and if its governing bodies don\\'t do enough to ensure that -- then the game will die.\"',\n",

Riley was fired by the North Carolina Courage last week after an investigative report by The Athletic that cites players on the record alleging that for years, Riley used his influence and power to sexually harass players and in one incident, coerce a player into having sex with him.  Riley denied the accusations in the Athletic report. CNN has not been able to reach Riley for comment.  The commissioner of the NWSL Lisa Baird resigned and the league called off all matches scheduled for last weekend as a result of the report detailing allegations of sexual coercion and misconduct against Riley, who coached three NWSL franchises over eight seasons.  In the Athletic report, former player Sinead Farrelly described how a married Riley coerced her into his hotel room to have sex.

Read MoreThe Athletic asked Riley to comment on his alleged misconduct, to which he replied the former players\\' claims were \"completely untrue.\" According to The Athletic, Riley told them in an email: \"I have never had sex with, or made sexual advances towards these players.\" Speaking to NBC on Tuesday alongside Shim and US Women\\'s National team striker Alex Morgan, Farrelly said the damage Riley has caused \"seeps into every part\" of their livelihoods.  \"I think it\\'s just really important and why we wanted to share our story and share in so much detail the damage that was done to our careers, but who we are as people,\" Farrelly, who played for Riley on three different teams, explained.  \"The damage to my self-confidence and how I saw myself and how I approach life, it seeps into every part of your livelihood,\" Farrelly told NBC.  \"There is a lot of loss that comes with that and things I will not get back and I think when we can tap into the emotional impact of just showing up to try and be your authentic self, it really can hit home for lot of people because it\\'s bigger than the sport. This is about safety in our own lives and our bodies and the players deserve that. We all deserve that. And that\\'s something that we will fight for.\" The NWSL matches scheduled for Wednesday will proceed as planned, the players union announced on Tuesday.Steve Baldwin, the CEO and managing partner of the NWSL\\'s Washington Spirit, resigned on Tuesday amid the fallout. Baldwin\\'s statement on Twitter referenced a recent request by the players as part of the reason for stepping down.  And while Shim said on NBC she was \"so just overcome with gratitude at everyone who has spoken out and supported us,\" she says she wants \"more justice.\"  \"I want more,\" she told NBC. \"I want more justice, I want better policies, I want players to be protected.\"  The Athletic reported that it interviewed over a dozen players who played under Riley since 2010 and others who are involved with women\\'s soccer.  Riley watches on during a North Carolina Courage match in July, 2021. Shim said that the support of her friends is what got her through.\"From early on, there was a possession, not just from Paul, but the team that I was playing for,\" she told NBC. \"They silenced me about multiple issues, my sexuality being the most important one.  \"And I just was very, very uncomfortable the whole time and every day I showed up to work, every day I practiced, every game I played, I didn\\'t have confidence and I was scared. I was scared and the only thing that got me through was my teammates. And Alex and Sinead, they\\'re two of my best friends. Thank god I had them.  \"I don\\'t know what I would do without them. Alex was the first person I told who said: \\'I will do anything to support you.\\' She was loyal from day one. That\\'s really the only way I got through it. And I\\'m still damaged.\"  Morgan, a former teammate of both Shim and Farrelly, said she will \"continue to amplify their voices and just show this systemic failure from the league and how wrong they did in handling Mana\\'s case and complaint and then investigation.\"\"I think when I look back, I tried to be as good of a friend and teammate as possible to Mana in helping her file a complaint when there at the time was no anti-harassment policy in place, there was no league HR, there was no anonymous hotline, there was no way to report,\" Morgan told NBC.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"We have now started to put these things in place by demand of players, not by being -- not by the league being proactive. So something we ask is for the league to start being proactive, not reactive.

              " ' (CNN)With another round of international matches looming in the football calendar, questions about players being released to represent their countries remain a headache for the Premier League.Under new guidelines announced last week, several Premier League footballers returning from international duty face 10 days in \"bespoke quarantine facilities\" -- a move that has irked Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. The guidelines say that fully-vaccinated players returning to the UK from \"red list\" countries -- including Brazil and Argentina -- will be allowed out of their quarantine facilities once a day to train or play in matches. But Klopp, for whom Brazil\\'s Alisson and Fabinho, Greece\\'s Kostas Tsimikas and Senegal\\'s Sadio Mane will be impacted by the 10-day quarantine measures, has voiced concerns about the decision. \"They go for 10-12 days with their national teams, and then they go another 10 days away from their families into quarantine,\" he told reporters last week. \"That\\'s 22 days, and two weeks later there\\'s the next international break. It doesn\\'t sound to me like a real solution.\"Read MoreKlopp went on to add: \"We take people for three weeks out of normal life for actually no real reason because we take care of our players when they\\'re here and with their families. \"They don\\'t do anything else. They go home, come to training and go home ... The Premier League has to fight for our players.\"The guidelines for Premier League players are different compared to members of the public returning from red list countries, who have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days after arriving in England. The exemption for players is also subject to strict protocols and a code of conduct to be agreed with clubs, the Football Association (FA) and Public Health England.From Monday, the UK government amended its travel rules, in part by scrapping its green and amber lists of countries. More than 50 countries remain on the red list. Jurgen Klopp has criticized new protocols for players returning to the UK from red-list countries. The current international break, during which teams will compete in the final stages of the UEFA Nations League and qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, runs from October 4-14; Premier League fixtures start again on October 16.  \"We have worked closely with football authorities to achieve an outcome that balances the interests of both club and country while maintaining the highest levels of public health and safety,\" a UK government spokesperson said in relation to the exemption for players on international duty. \"Our best defence against the virus is vaccination and these new measures will allow fully vaccinated players to fulfill their international duties in the safest, most practical way possible, while allowing them to train and play with their clubs as early as possible upon their return.\"Alongside the FA and FIFA, the Premier League tried to find a solution to shorten players\\' quarantine period but accepted the UK health authorities\\' desire to maintain a 10-day quarantine. The protocols will be reviewed by the governing bodies over the course of this international window. \"FIFA welcomes the UK government`s decision to allow fully vaccinated players the opportunity to represent their countries in the upcoming qualifying matches for the FIFA World Cup and return from a red-list country to bespoke quarantine conditions,\" said a statement from football\\'s governing body. \"We have worked closely with the UK government, Football Association and Premier League to find a reasonable solution, in the interests of everyone, and we believe this is a much more desirable solution to the situation that players faced in September.\"The statement added: \"We acknowledge this decision does not help every player and we remain committed to further improving the situation for upcoming windows and joining discussions to explain more about the many measures we are putting in place to reduce the risks of Covid transmission into the community as a result of player travel.\"Liverpool\\'s Sadio Mane is set to represent Senegal during the international break.

Then in September, there were chaotic scenes as the World Cup qualifier between Brazil and Argentina was suspended minutes after kickoff when four Argentinian players were accused of breaking Covid travel protocols. Brazilian health officials marched onto the pitch in S찾o Paulo and claimed that the players in question had made false statement upon arriving in Brazil, omitting that they had been in the UK in the past 14 days.

              " 'Paris (CNN)Members of the Catholic clergy in France sexually abused an estimated 216,000 minors over the past seven decades, according to a damning report published Tuesday that said the Church had prioritized the protection of the institution over victims who were urged to stay silent. The number of abused minors rises to an estimated 330,000 when including victims of people who were not clergy but had other links to the Church, such as Catholic schools and youth programs. Between 2,900 and 3,200 abusers were estimated to have혻worked in the French Catholic Church between 1950 and 2020, out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics, the report found. \"The Catholic Church is the place where the prevalence of sexual violence is at its highest, other than in family and friend circles,\" said the report, which found that children were also more likely to abused within Church settings than in state-run schools or summer camps.\"Faced with this scourge, for a very long time the Catholic Church\\'s immediate reaction was to protect itself as an institution and it has shown complete, even cruel, indifference to those having suffered abuse.\"Tuesday\\'s report, the most complete account of sexual abuse in the French Catholic Church to date, was compiled by an independent commission at the request of Church officials. It follows similar reports from other countries that have dealt a blow to the reputation of the Church in recent years. Read MoreJean-Marc Sauv챕, the president of the Independent Commission on Sexual Abuse in the Church (CIASE) which authored the report, said the abuse was systemic and not limited to \"a few black sheep that strayed from the flock.\" Abuse of minors within the Church accounts for close to 4% of all sexual violence in France, Sauv챕 said at a news conference Tuesday. Most of the violence happened between 1950 and 1968, he said, but it still persists today, adding, \"the problem is not behind us, it is still here.\" Up to 3,200 pedophiles worked in French Catholic Church since 1950, independent commission saysFran챌ois Devaux, head of the abuse victims\\' group La Parole Lib챕r챕e, told Church representatives they were \"a disgrace to humanity\" at the news conference. \"You must all pay for these crimes,\" Devaux told the clergymen, slowly enunciating each word before repeating the phrase again. \"In this hell, there have been atrocious crimes committed for decades ... there was a betrayal: betrayal of trust, betrayal of morality, betrayal of children, betrayal of innocence of your own people, betrayal of the gospel, betrayal of the original message, betrayal of everything.\"Archbishop Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, the head of France\\'s Conference of Bishops, said Tuesday that the scale of abuse outlined in the report was \"more than we ever could have imagined,\" and asked forgiveness to \"those who were victims of such acts.\"Jean-Marc Sauv챕, head of the independent commission behind the report, delivered its findings on Tuesday in Paris. \\'Concealment and denial\\'The investigation was commissioned in 2018 by French Catholic clergy groups and financed by the French Catholic Bishops conference, but members are not paid and acted independently of the Church.  The commission was permitted to access the archives of dioceses and religious institutions.    Sauv챕, a former civil servant, headed a 21-member interdisciplinary panel of experts from diverse religious backgrounds to produce CIASE\\'s report. It gathered direct testimony from nearly 6,500 people, leading to the identification of 2,700 abuse victims, Sauv챕 said, adding that a further 4,800 were identified by combing through Church archives and press clippings.   \"These people were victims. They became witnesses and in this sense, actors of the truth. It is thanks to them that this report has been conceived and written,\" the report summary said. The estimated numbers of abused children were extrapolated from a survey for the commission by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, who worked with the polling agency IFOP to survey a representative national sample of more than 28,000 people over the age of 18 online between November 25, 2020 and January 28, 2021.The report estimated the number of survivors nationwide over time based on the number of survey respondents who said they had been abused. The national survey came in addition to a public call for victim testimonies. The panel also interviewed 11 abusers from the clergy to shed light on their motivations and how they viewed their actions, Sauv챕 said.Sauv챕 said his commission drew on similar investigations conducted in the United States, Ireland and Australia. He said it was only the second time a survey of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church had been carried out among the general population. \"This had only been done in one country, the Netherlands, and only on the Dutch population above 40,\" he added. Vatican revises Church law on sexual abuse and other issuesThe Catholic Church in France has taken a number of steps to tackle the scourge of sexual abuse in recent years. In 2019, the Diocese of Paris signed a protocol with the city prosecutor to allow suspected abuse to be investigated without survivors making an official complaint to the authorities. More than half the abuses detailed in the report occurred before 1969, Sauv챕 told CNN, when he said the Church in France ignored abuse by people it put in power.      \"This first period ... is marked by absolutely total indifference of the Church towards victims. The suffering of victims, the harm (suffered by) victims, the trauma of victims, in fact, does not exist,\" Sauv챕 said.   The report said that over the 70 years examined by the commission, \"the Church\\'s attitude could be summarized as one of concealment, relativization or even denial, with only a very recent recognition dating from 2015, and even then, unequally accepted by dioceses and religious institutions.\"While the Church has taken \"important steps\" to prevent sexual violence in recent years, the report described them as reactive and insufficient. It also warned that although \"these acts of violence were in decline up until the early 1990s, they have since stopped decreasing.\" Recommendations and compensation The report issued 45 recommendations, including that the Church\\'s canon laws be revised.\"Generally, transgressions of sexual morality in the Catholic Church are associated with the sixth commandment, \\'You shall not commit adultery,\\'\" Sauv챕 said. The report recommends that \"the Church pay heed to the fact that sexual violence, and rape in particular of course, are a work of death, which in reality fall under the commandment \\'You shall not kill.\\'\" The report also calls for a message to be sent that \"the secret of confession cannot change the obligation ... to signal cases of sexual violence inflicted on a minor or vulnerable person to judicial and administrative authorities.The report\\'s summary said that \"reinforcing the presence of secular figures and women in particularly in decision making spheres\" of the Church \"seems not only useful but necessary,\" and suggested \"psychological evaluation\" for trainee priests.It also recommends that priests receive training in law, particularly with regards to the rights of children. Future priests should be trained, to have \"a critical spirit with regards to questions of authority and obedience,\" it said.The Vatican revised its canon laws in June to expand explicitly forbidden sexual offenses and, in Pope Francis\\'s words, \"reduce the number of cases in which the imposition of a penalty was left to the discretion of authorities.\"   The report also recommends that the Church puts in place a mechanism to compensate the victims of sexual abuses committed by its clergy and to put in place an \"independent process to officially recognize\" survivors if the statute of limitations has expired, or if the offender has died. \"This isn\\'t about handouts or rescuing victims. It is simply about repairing the ... damage that the Church has a responsibility in,\" Sauv챕 said. \"It is in fact a debt the Church owes victims.\"  \\'I will die with the trauma of what happened\\'  One of the thousands of victims who testified before the commission was Christian Dubreuil, now aged 65.  \"Pedophilia is the perfect crime because it is the only one for which the criminal is sure, or almost sure, that the victim will not report them,\" he told the commission in public testimony. A senior aide to French government ministers before his retirement, Dubreuil grew up not far from Lyon. He says he was a shy and studious child in a family without much history of formal education.      Dubreuil\\'s abuser slipped into the family circle under the guise of furthering a bright boy\\'s education, he says. Every Thursday, he would pick him up and they would visit historical sites together.      Dubreuil described his abuser\\'s infiltration of his family as \"the spinning of a spider web that traps you.\"      Dubreuil remembers being abused in his family\\'s living room, as his parents worked in their shop below. He said the abuse lasted for nine months, starting when he was 11 and lasting beyond his twelfth birthday.      \"I will die with the trauma of what happened, even though it was more than half a century ago,\" he added.    Dubreuil said he hoped the report would lead the Church to admit to systemic abuse and cover-ups in France.  \"They ... thought there was an exception for the French religion, which supposedly meant that, a few specific cases aside, the French Church was not affected. This lie will collapse.\" ',\n",

Found in a Welsh quarry, the newly identified dinosaur species is a theropod -- a group that includes Tyrannosaurus rex and modern birds. About a meter (or 3.28 feet) long -- including its tail -- it would have lived about 200 to 215 million years ago, at the dawn of dinosaur evolution.\"Pendraig milnerae lived near the beginning of the evolution of the meat-eating dinosaurs. It\\'s clear from the bones we have that it was a meat-eater, but early in the evolution of this group these animals were quite small, in contrast to the very famous meat-eating dinosaurs like T. rex which evolved much later,\" said Stephan Spiekman, a research fellow at the Natural History Museum in London and lead author of a new study on the findings, in a news release.The study was published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.The name \"Pendraig\" means \"chief dragon\" in Middle Welsh, and it\\'s a reference to dinosaur\\'s likely role as an apex predator of the area and its discovery in Wales. \"Milnerae\" honors Angela Milner, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum who passed away on August 13.

              " ' (CNN)When thousands gathered to mourn the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old woman who was kidnapped, raped and murdered in March, London police responded with force. Scenes of grieving women being pinned to the ground and brutalized by Metropolitan Police officers shocked people across the United Kingdom. Everard was just walking home when she was snatched from the street -- to the mourners it felt like it could have happened to them. They had gathered to \"Reclaim These Streets,\" as the group that organized the vigil is called, and to honor a lost sister. But London\\'s police called the event an illegal gathering and handcuffed some participants, citing Covid regulations. Prosecutors would later say Covid-19 rules were used by one of their own officers to detain and then kidnap Everard. On the night of March 3, Wayne Couzens, a serving Met police officer, spent the entire evening \"hunting a lone female to kidnap and rape,\" according to the judge that sentenced him on Thursday. Couzens stopped Everard on the street by identifying himself as police, \"arresting\" her under the pretense of breaking Covid rules. He raped her later that evening and strangled her with his police belt. A week later, her remains were found in a woodland in Ashford, Kent -- more than 50 miles from where she was last seen. Everard is not the first woman to be killed by a British policeman. And campaigners fear she won\\'t be the last. Read MoreSarah Everard\\'s murderer kidnapped her using police ID and handcuffsAt least 16 women have been killed by serving or retired police officers over the last 13 years in the UK, according to the Femicide Census, a group that collects data on women killed by men, and campaigners feel that tackling gender-based violence is not a police priority. There are hundreds of allegations of gender-based violence by police officers every year. Nearly 700 domestic abuse allegations were launched against police officers and staff from April 2015-2017, according to a 2019 Bureau of Investigative Journalism investigation. It also found that domestic abuse at the hands of the police are treated differently in court, with just 3.9% of domestic abuse allegations among police in England and Wales ending in a conviction, compared with 6.2% among the general population.  As fatal intimate partner violence is typically the culmination of years of abuse and coercive control, there is an urgent need to reform the criminal justice system, activists say. And that needs to start from the ground up. A woman attending the Sarah Everard vigil in south London on March 13, 2021 is arrested by police.  Harriet Wistrich, solicitor and director of the Centre for Women\\'s Justice (CWJ), told CNN that there is a \"kind of boys\\' locker room type culture within policing, which means that often, officers are loyal to their fellow colleagues over and above undertaking proper investigations -- and that women are fearful of reporting to the police. And if they do, sometimes they\\'re the ones that are victimized.\"The CWJ filed a \"super complaint\" to the UK police watchdog in 2019, highlighting the difficulties that around 150 domestic abuse survivors faced in trying to navigate a path to justice. This August, the Independent Office for Police Conduct published its findings, saying that the criminal justice system is failing to function effectively in responding to domestic abuse -- despite the government\\'s claim that it\\'s a priority. (The Domestic Violence Act, which was passed this spring, creates a statutory definition of domestic abuse and established the role of a domestic abuse commissioner.) Since the complaint was filed, more women have come forward with allegations about domestic violence by police, Wistrich said, allegations that fuel deeper concerns about gender-based violence in the force. Speaking outside the courthouse where Couzens was handed a rare whole life sentence on Thursday, Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick -- who in June dismissed Couzens as an isolated \"bad \\'un,\" -- said that she was horrified that he had used a \"position of trust to deceive and coerce Sarah.\" Dick apologized on behalf of the Met and acknowledged that trust in the police had been \"shaken.\" She said as commissioner that she would \"do everything in my power to ensure we learn any lessons.\" On the frontline with the British feminists trying to close the gap between rights and realitySix years ago, as an officer with the Kent Police force, Couzens was accused of indecent exposure. Three days before Everard\\'s murder, he was accused of exposing himself at a fast food restaurant in south London. An investigation has since been opened into the alleged failures by the Met to investigate two allegations against Couzens of indecent exposure in February. Another investigation is looking into allegations that five serving officers and one former officer shared grossly offensive material with Couzens on a WhatsApp group in 2019. And a separate investigation was also opened into allegations that an officer taking part in the search for Everard shared an inappropriate graphic depicting violence against women in a WhatsApp group with colleagues at the time of her disappearance. Inappropriate behavior is not new in the force. In June 2020, after sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry were brutally murdered in London, two Met police officers took selfies next to their bodies and shared them on WhatsApp. Six other officers failed to report it.  There is no room for police officers with \"question marks\" over their previous conduct in the force, Wistrich said.  People protest violence against women and a bill that would give police greater powers in Cardiff, Wales, on March 17. The Met said in a statement that Couzens had been vetted when he joined and had \"no criminal convictions or cautions,\" but that: \"Vetting is a snapshot in time and unfortunately, can never 100% guarantee an individual\\'s integrity.\"  But it also has a history of abetting sexual misconduct. As Couzens was sentenced on Thursday, a landmark judgment from the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT) ruled that the Met had violated an environmental activist\\'s human rights after she had been deceived into a long-term sexual relationship by an undercover officer. Senior officers probably had a \"a lack of interest in protecting women\" from breaching their human rights and privacy, it said.  The IPT ruling thrusts the spotlight onto other documented abuses of power in the force. From March 2017-2019, 415 referrals were made for officers that had abused their position to sexually assault someone, with domestic and sexual violence victims, sex workers and drug users most at risk of being abused by an on-duty police officer, according to a 2018 Her Majesty\\'s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services report.  Nearly 500 Met police officers were accused of sexual misconduct, including assault and harassment from April 1, 2014-March 31, 2020, according to data released by a Freedom of Information request. Of the 493 complaints, 148 resulted in an investigation. Violence against women in the force is \"not an isolated incident,\" says Wistrich. \"It\\'s something, much more kind of rotten within the system that that has to be rooted out.\"On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the police\\'s failure to take violence against women and girls sufficiently seriously as \"infuriating,\" in an interview with The Times. \"Are the police taking this issue seriously enough? It\\'s infuriating. I think the public feel that they aren\\'t and they\\'re not wrong,\" Johnson said.\"There is an issue about how we handle sexual violence, domestic violence, the sensitivity, the diligence, the time, the delay ... that\\'s the thing we need to fix,\" he said,\" adding that the government is trying to \"compress\" the time between complaints being filed by women and at the point at which action is taken. Rape allegations continue to rise, but cases charged by the Crown Prosecution Service have dropped markedly, according to an October 2020 Victims Commissioner report, which said that in 2019-20 there were 55,000 reports of rape to the police, but only 1,867 cases charged. Plus, the proportion of survivors who chose to withdraw their case is on the rise (from 25% in 2015-16 to 41% in 2019-20). And the government\\'s current strategy doesn\\'t fill many women\\'s rights activists with hope. The government has separated domestic abuse from their new Violence Against Women and Girls strategy, a move that many say misses the crucial point that women\\'s experiences of violence and abuse are interconnected.In response to criticisms of the Met made in this article, a spokesperson told CNN in a statement: \"There are numerous wide-ranging points here -- mostly the views of critics and commentators, and we\\'re not setting out to knock back any criticisms they may wish to make.\"Disconnect and consentSince Couzens\\' sentencing, high-ranking police have been on a media blitz to signal they understand trust has been broken with the public, saying they will take steps to regain it. They\\'ve also outlined measures they believe women should take to feel safer. Women approached by lone police officers have a right to seek verification that the officer detaining them is legitimate, the Met said in a Friday statement.But that wouldn\\'t have stopped Couzens from \"arresting\" Everard. He wasn\\'t disguised as a police officer, he was a Met police officer -- with an officially issued warrant card to hand.The statement also said that if a woman has doubts about the validity of the arrest, they\\'d advise \"running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down\" or calling police. Tributes to Sarah Everard are seen at Clapham Common on March 15 in London.Activists argue the police guidance is tone deaf, places the onus on women to take responsibility for avoiding crimes against them and shifts the focus away from the real problem: How to best identify and stamp out predators in their ranks. A member of Sisters Uncut, a direct-action feminist group who led the Everard vigil in March called the advice \"ridiculous.\"Mirry, who asked CNN to be identified by her first name for safety, said that the Met\\'s \"advice shows the disconnect between the management of the police and the day-to-day experiences of the people who assumedly they serve.\"She added: \"I think the focus of this advice is to make it seem as if Couzens was a cop gone rogue, when in fact we know that he was very much of part of a product of the institution.\"Activists also argue that crucially, such advice fails to take into consideration the concerns of people of color and minority backgrounds, who are disproportionately stopped by authorities in comparison to their White counterparts. They also say it\\'s ableist, with police having not considered the rights of disabled people.London police warn women to be wary of lone officers after Sarah Everard murderThe Met\\'s new guidance comes as the UK Home Secretary calls for an overhaul of policing. On Thursday, Priti Patel said that \"all of us want to feel safe and be safe.\"Patel has also been backing a bill that will give more powers to the police, including tougher stop and search powers. For months, thousands have demonstrated against the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill -- which is currently making its way through Parliament. The details of Everard\\'s murder could add to that resistance.  \"There\\'s a kind of myth in this country of policing by consent, that the police are able to exercise force over us because they have the confidence of the public because we consent to it,\" Mirry said, adding: \"In the case of Sarah Reed (a victim of police brutality who died in prison) it\\'s used to beat us up; in the case of Sarah Everard, it\\'s used to kill us.\"We do not consent to have force used against us in the name of our own protection,\" she said.',\n",
              " ' (CNN)Between 2,900 and 3,200 pedophile clergymen have worked in the French Catholic Church since the 1950s, the president of an independent commission on sexual abuse told CNN Sunday. \"We had to cross historical, sociological, medical and psychiatric perspectives. We had to call upon skills in the area of child protection, social work, questions of abuse and also bring to bear skills in the area of theology and law,\" said Jean-Marc Sauv챕, ahead of the release of the commission\\'s final report on Tuesday.The report aims to establish the facts and provide an understanding of what happened in order to prevent \"such tragedies\" from taking place in the future. But the report does not aim to establish \"personal responsibility,\" according to the commission\\'s website.The commission -- made up of 21 people -- was set up in 2018 by the French Catholic Church hierarchy and religious institutes after abuse scandals came to light.It is financed by the French Catholic Bishops conference, but members are not paid and do not receive instructions from the Church. The archives of dioceses and religious institutions were accessible to the commission.Read MoreSauv챕 said creating the commission was an important stepping stone towards addressing \"this secret and hideous side of our society\" and that an \"enormous amount of work\" had gone into building the report over the last 32 months.\"We worked a lot with the victims, and we did not delegate the task of listening to all the victims to research laboratories. Of course, the research laboratories did some of the hearings, but we conducted a large number of hearings ourselves,\" Sauv챕 said.Some of the thousands of victims identified were directed towards organizations that provide legal, medical and psychological support.\"I went through a season of hell,\" Christian Dubreuil, a victim who was abused when he was 11 years old, testified before the commission.\"I hope you can take them out of this sort of isolation syndrome, of blindness\" Dubreuil said of the French Catholic Church.\"They are still in denial, contempt, and minimize issues.\"혻This commission was set up before Pope Francis issued an edict in May 2019 that established new rules for reporting sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, mandating for the first time that all dioceses set up systems for reporting abuse and cover-ups.혻CNN has reached out to the French Catholic Church for comment.\\'Waiting for this for years\\'The report into sexual abuse in the French Catholic Church -- set to publish Tuesday -- will \"change everything,\" Katherine Dalle, head of communications for the Bishops\\' Conference of France (CEF), told CNN Sunday.\"It is a very important moment for people who have been abused. It is an important moment for the church in France. Jean-Marc Sauv챕 has done remarkable work,\" she said. Church authorities sent a message to be read at every Parish in the country during Sunday Mass. It says that the publication of Tuesday\\'s report \"will be a test of truth and a tough and serious moment.\"\"Pedophilia concerns all of us. I invite all of you to have an attitude of truthfulness and compassion among yourselves with regards to this report,\" it continues. Olivier Savignac, who runs a victims group called Parler and Revivre, said the release of the report would be like \"a cyclone, a tsunami, a hurricane.\"\"This report will show the collective responsibility of the church,\" he said. \"We will finally have figures on the scale of the abuse, collected scientifically. We have been waiting for this for years.\"The Catholic Church in France has taken a number of steps to tackle the scourge of sexual abuse in recent years. In 2019, the Diocese of Paris signed a protocol with the city prosecutor to allow suspected abuse to be investigated without victims making an official complaint to the authorities.In March this year, the church voted in favor of 11 resolutions to tackle the problem, including: the establishment of a council \"for the prevention and fight against pedophilia\" and financial \"contribution\" for victims.Savignac concedes that safeguards put in place have made it harder for abuse to take place, but told CNN that the \"fight is not over.\"\"It is important for victims to see justice. Nine out of 10 people cannot get justice because the statute of limitations has passed or the perpetrator has died,\" he said.\"There has always been collusion between the church in France and the Vatican to protect perpetrators of abuse. The church has been too moderate in following the word of God and taking care of the smallest and the weakest.\"',\n",

              " 'London (CNN)On Sunday, Boris Johnson will walk among his Conservative faithful for the first time since October 2019, as members of the UK\\'s governing party gather in the English city of Manchester for their 2021 conference. He does so as Britain faces numerous crises, from fuel shortages bringing its roads to a grinding halt to energy prices soaring due to unusually low gas supplies. There are serious concerns that the UK will experience food shortages as it approaches Christmas, while supermarket shelves are already looking bare in some areas.It\\'s hard to fathom that the last time Johnson attended a party conference, he did so as the new leader and, in the eyes of many, a conquering hero on a mission to finally deliver Brexit -- an issue that had paralyzed the UK since 2016.Since then, Johnson has won a parliamentary majority, delivered a version of Brexit harder than many dreamed -- or feared -- possible, been engulfed in numerous scandals for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and faced harsh criticism from many of his former supporters, who now question his competence. Some are quick to blame Johnson\\'s extreme interpretation of Brexit -- introducing hard trade barriers with Britain\\'s closest trading partner and restricting the ability of Europeans to work in the UK -- for the shortages. Read MoreOthers blame the shock of a global pandemic that has impeded movement between countries and disrupted supply chains. A Shell garage employee holds a sign on the side of the road informing a queue of traffic that they do not have unleaded petrol on September 25, 2021, in Blackheath, London.Motorists queue for petrol and diesel fuel at a petrol station off of the M3 motorway near Fleet, west of London, on September 26.The truth is it\\'s probably a combination of the two. What\\'s tricky for Johnson, though, is that industry leaders and logistics experts are increasingly united in their belief that these problems could have been mitigated had the Prime Minister and his government heeded their warnings months, and in some cases years, before pumps ran dry and shelves emptied.Boris Johnson\\'s Brexit choices are making Britain\\'s fuel and food shortages worseThe most pressing issue is without question the shortage of fuel. The reason for these shortages is simple: there are not enough qualified tanker drivers to deliver fuel to filling stations. Labor shortages are also partly responsible for the other woes facing Brits. From seasonal workers who pick and process fresh food to, again, drivers delivering that food in and out of cold stores, the UK could be on its way to a grim winter if fuel or food is scarce in the run-up to Christmas. Capping off the potential for seasonal misery: heating homes could suddenly become much more expensive due to gas shortages. While this one cannot be solely blamed on Brexit, the government can be questioned on why a small island with a large population has among the lowest gas storage capacity in Europe.A woman walks past empty shelves that stock chicken at an Asda supermarket on September 19, 2021, in London.Can Britain\\'s bleak winter be avoided? The short answer is yes, according to those who best know the issues at hand. Claire Walker, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, told CNN that while business accepts the government has \"made clear its priority is to transition from a reliance on EU workers to a focus on the domestic workforce,\" an undertaking such as this \"requires careful planning and close working between business and government.\"Unfortunately, many of those working in the affected industries point to a trend in the thinking of Johnson and his government that suggests they might not be willing to smooth this transition if it tramples on their Brexiteer principles. \"The government has consistently made decisions that seem to prioritize Brexit over avoiding potential disasters,\" says Anna Jerzewska, founder of Trade and Borders, a consultancy that advises importers and exporters. She points to the summer of 2020, when the UK had the option to remain in the EU\\'s customs union and single market a little longer, to cope with the strains on supply chains presented by the collision of Brexit and Covid. \"While they can credibly claim that Covid was a disaster no one could predict, we did know that leaving the transition period during a winter spike would create huge issues. They had time to put procedures in place but chose not to. And all the while, they left clients like mine, in the middle of a pandemic, without guidance on the post-Brexit arrangement until the very last minute.\"Boris Johnson with his wife Carrie Johnson following his keynote speech at the 2019 Conservative Party Conference in Manchester.When it comes to gas shortages, consecutive governments declined to build up the UK\\'s capacity to store liquid gas, instead relying on a just-in-time supply chain -- as it does with many other critical products like foods and medical equipment. \"There is nothing preventing the government from maintaining gas reserves or PPE stockpiles. It\\'s just that we seem to like living life on the edge,\" says Sam Lowe, senior fellow at the Centre for European Reform. Time running out to save UK industry from worker shortages, say business leaders\"Just-in-time is a perfectly valid way to run your economy,\" he adds, but \"when you are fundamentally changing your entire economic model and living through an unprecedented crisis, it makes sense to have reserves of critical products to avoid a crunch-point crisis.\" Charitable onlookers might say that predicting the need to stockpile because of the pandemic would require appointing Nostradamus to your cabinet. However, the potential for a pandemic has been high on the UK\\'s risk radar for years now. The UK\\'s 2015 National Risk Register placed \"Influenza pandemic\" as its first bullet in the section labeled \"The highest priority risks.\" In 2017, the register made specific mention of airborne human diseases. A government spokesperson responded to the criticisms made by interviewees in this article by saying that the \"recent challenges that have arisen across Europe are the result of a unique and unprecedented combination of issues, and we are working closely with businesses to support them through this period.\"They said that the government is in regular contact with the food and farming organizations and industry to help them manage the situation.\" They added that \"domestic gas storage capacity has had little bearing on the price of gas\" and that \"UK is not dependent on Russian oil or gas\" as it \"benefits from access to gas reserves in British territorial waters and secure sources from reliable import partners, such as Norway.\"One way or another, it seems Johnson had ample time to cushion the blow for British citizens. The question is, why didn\\'t he?To get an answer, CNN spoke with multiple current and former government officials, all of whom worked with Johnson during the period when such decisions could have been made. All spoke on the condition of anonymity.\"When we first came into office, the country had been exhausted by Brexit\\'s deadlock,\" says a former senior adviser to Johnson. \"All we talked about was how to call an election, win a majority and do Brexit. We genuinely feared if it dragged on any longer it could lead to something nasty happening in society. There was limited capacity for anything else.\" Another senior government adviser described the focus of the time being solely on delivering Brexit with a smile, even though fears over driver shortages and medicine supply chains were already causing departmental headaches. Other government officials say that this insistence on optimism meant that Johnson had blind spots when it came to the realities of Brexit and Covid dovetailing. Boris Johnson during the 2019 general election campaign. \"He doesn\\'t like dealing with a reality. He only wants to go out and tell the public that everything\\'s going great,\" says one former senior official. \"We tried to tell him that at some point shortages of all sorts were likely and he can\\'t just smile and pretend things are not happening.\" On one hand, Johnson has been unlucky, a former government minister and Johnson loyalist says. \"It is entirely reasonable for a new government to look at all of the hypothetical things that could happen, including a pandemic, and ask how likely it is to hit while we are in office.\" However, the former minister concedes that it is, on the other hand, entirely reasonable to ask why \"a government introducing once-in-a-generation changes like Brexit wouldn\\'t do everything in its power to stop even the least likely disaster compounding Brexit difficulties.\"Could it really be that the reason the UK was so ill-prepared for events that had been predicted is simply because Johnson doesn\\'t like dealing in bad news? Motorists queue to fill their cars at a Sainsbury\\'s fuel station in Ashford, England,  Saturday, September 25.Even his closest allies admit that blind optimism is a trait of this Prime Minister. \"I would never want to temper Boris\\' enthusiasm, but he does need to hire people who make up for his weaknesses and are more interested in getting down into the detail than top-level, good news vision type stuff,\" a former senior adviser to Johnson says. There are short-term fixes for Johnson, should he want to lessen these crises. He could further U-turn on short-term visas, allowing more foreign workers to plug gaps. He could seek a closer relationship with the EU to shore up supply chains and stockpiles. However, until there is sufficient pressure on Johnson from either the public or his party to do so, any options that involves more immigration or more Europe is a nonstarter for the man who embodied Brexit. The fuel crisis has damaged Johnson badly, though it hasn\\'t handed the opposition Labour Party sufficient polling gains that should worry Johnson on the assumption that the shortages will soon end. He is, despite all of this, still a relatively secure leader with a big majority and broad public appeal. The question Johnson\\'s Conservative delegates must consider as they gather for the first time since the world turned upside down: is the man who, two years ago, used a feel-good platform to bulldoze through the Brexit deadlock and get a specific job done also the best man to lead in a crisis? And if not, then how can they displace a popular leader with a majority before the next scheduled election in 2024?',\n",

Everard, 33, was kidnapped, raped and murdered in March by Wayne Couzens, a British policeman who was sentenced to life in prison without parole this week. Her killing sparked an outcry and national reckoning over an epidemic of violence against women and girls in the United Kingdom, but activists say little has changed in the six months since. In late September, the murder of another woman in London, 28-year-old Sabina Nessa, renewed the outcry.\"Are the police taking this issue seriously enough? It\\'s infuriating.

The group argues that the government\\'s new strategy to curb such violence \"shamefully ignores\" victims of femicide.The government has promised to take action to tackle violence against women and girls, but activists and the opposition say the steps it proposed were inadequate.Speaking to The Times, Johnson said that while there are hundreds of thousands of \"wonderful police officers\" in the UK, there are issues in the way that women are treated by the police and how complaints by women are handled. \"Far, far too many women are basically finding their lives lost to this system, waiting for their complaint to be taken seriously, waiting for their case to be heard, and nothing is happening,\" Johnson said.The Metropolitan Police declined to provide a new comment in response to Johnson\\'s interview, but directed CNN to an earlier statement issued Thursday which stressed that recent cases of violence against women have brought into \"sharp focus\" the police\\'s \"urgent duty to do more to protect women and girls.\" A London teacher was killed on a walk to the pub, police say.

And there are hundreds of allegations of gender-based violence by police officers every year.Speaking following the sentencing of Couzens on Thursday, London\\'s Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she was \"sickened\" by the abuse of power in the case of Everard\\'s murder. \"There are no words that can fully express the fury, and overwhelming sadness that we all feel about what happened to Sarah.

That\\'s just really sad for me and I really want to help them.\"Read MoreTargeting children in areas where they have restricted access to sport and education, Skateistan fuses skateboarding with \"creative arts-based education\" to \"give children the opportunity to become leaders for a better world,\" according to the organization\\'s website.With a specific focus on girls, children with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Skateistan has partnered with the British teen skateboarder and boardmaker Almost -- designing a line of unique, Brown-inspired skateboards to be sold, with 20% of the proceeds going directly to Skateistan. According to their website, Skateistan primarily focuses on efforts in Cambodia, South Africa and Jordan, but has run several projects in Afghanistan and has a Skate School in Kabul.\"I want to show the world that girls can do anything,\" added Brown, who has been working with Skateistan since 2017. \"Girls can do anything that boys can do but even better, and I feel like sport teaches us confidence and independence.\"I hope to do a lot more in Cambodia and Afghanistan, even in England -- just everywhere.\"Brown poses with her Olympic bronze at Ariake Urban Sports Park. For Brown, skateboarding is the perfect medium to express oneself, especially since age is no barrier to participation. Having first picked up a board as a toddler, the 13-year-old loves the sport\\'s atmosphere.\"Skateboarding is like one big family. Skateboarding is beautiful,\" Brown said.\"There\\'s no age -- just get out there and go for it. Have fun. Enjoy because you love it, take baby steps.\"Even if you\\'re super old like even 80 years old -- there\\'s people skating in Japan that I know that\\'s 80 years old and even Tony Hawk -- he\\'s 50 and he\\'s still ripping it,\" added Brown, referring to the legendary US skateboarder.Sibling rivalry Skating quickly over the implication that 50 is old -- for Hawk\\'s sake more than anyone\\'s -- Brown also shed light on her remarkable Tokyo experience.Having made mistakes in her first two runs, Brown nailed a kickflip Indy en route to a flawless final run that saw the youngster pip 15-year-old Japanese skateboarder Misugu Okamoto to a history-making bronze.The gold medal winner was Okamoto\\'s compatriot Sakura Yosozumi -- who Brown revealed is now one of her \"best friends\" after the Japanese skateboarder played a pivotal role in the Briton\\'s recovery ahead of the final run.\"She [Sakura] is the one who really made me feel like I actually got it,\" Brown said.\"She was giving me a hug and said \\'Look into my eyes ... Sky, you got it. We believe in you, we know you\\'re gonna get this, just stick it.\\' And yeah, she just made me just want to stick it so bad.\"Brown is also an avid surfer with dreams of competing at the Paris Olympics in 2024, though the youngster\\'s hopes of competing across two events may be complicated by the fact that the surfing event is set to take place over 9,000 miles away in Tahiti. Brown surfs at a beach in Takanabe town, Miyazaki prefecture.\"I love surfing, it\\'s just like skateboarding to me,\" Brown said.\"Tahiti sounds really nice, I\\'ve never been there.

It proves the appetite for women\\'s cycling and that the riders can do one of the hardest races in the world.\"\"Today I was the third rider (in the team) and I had to be in the front at the first cobbled section to protect my leaders. But then I saw there was a gap so I just kept going.\"Read MoreAfter three circuits around Denain, Trek Segafredo rider Deignan established a small lead over the pack just before the first of 17 cobbled sections with more than 80km remaining.With riders struggling to organize a concerted chase, many of them slithering over on the greasy cobbles, former world champion Deignan powered into a commanding lead.With 30km remaining the Trek-Segafredo rider held a lead of two minutes 30 seconds over a group including Vos (Jumbo Visma), team mate Audrey Cordon-Ragot and Germany\\'s Lisa Brennauer (Ceratizit-WNT).Deignan, handling the bone-shaking \"pave\" cobblestones with aplomb, maintained her advantage as several fancied riders including European champion Ellen van Dijk crashed heavily.Deignan will receive 1,535 euros for winning the Paris Roubaix Femmes -- about 1/20th of what the winner of the men\\'s race will take home. Vos finally put the hammer down to try and catch Deignan, slicing into the lead as she powered through the Carrefour de L\\'Arbre cobbled section.Vos closed the gap to 1:18 as Deignan began the final 10km, but Deignan proved unshakeable out front as the famed Roubaix velodrome finish approached.Deignan was so far ahead that the finale inside the Roubaix velodrome resembled a lap of honor as the Yorkshire rider wrote her name into the cycling history books.Vos finished more than a minute behind, with Deignan\\'s team mate Elisa Longo Borghini in third place.Organizers ASO, who also own the Tour de France, added a women\\'s version of the 125-year-old Paris Roubaix last year, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant they had to wait another year to ride the so-called Hell of the North.The debut for the Paris Roubaix Femmes race and for a women\\'s Tour de France next year are seen as steps forward in the long battle for gender equality in professional cycling, although there remains a long way to go.While Sunday\\'s men\\'s race over a longer distance boasts a total prize pot of 91,000 euros, the women\\'s race has only 7,505 euros with Deignan receiving 1,535 euros - about 1/20th of what the winner of the men\\'s race will take home.

Riley was fired by the North Carolina Courage on Thursday after an investigative report by The Athletic that cites players on the record alleging that for years, Riley used his influence and power to sexually harass players and in one incident, coerce a player into having sex with him.Riley denied the accusations in the report. CNN has not been able to reach Riley for comment. Lisa Baird speaks  during the Wilf Family Welcome Event at Exploria Stadium in Orlando, Florida, on August 4, 2021.The league released one sentence about Commissioner Lisa Baird, saying she resigned and the league accepted.Earlier, the NWSL said the league\\'s decision not to play this weekend\\'s matches was reached in collaboration with the players union and was based on \"the gravity of the events of the last week.\"Read MoreA statement from the players\\' union said it was a difficult decision to ask for the matches to be called off. The union recognized that fans made travel plans and spent money to go to the matches. It also recognized that playing is what gives the players joy.\"We refuse to let that joy be taken from us. We also recognize, however, that mental health struggles are real,\" the statement said. The priority this weekend will be for players to take care of themselves, the statement said.Baird had apologized for the fallout: \"This week, and much of this season, has been incredibly traumatic for our players and staff, and I take full responsibility for the role I have played.\"I am so sorry for the pain so many are feeling. Recognizing that trauma, we have decided not to take the field this weekend to give everyone some space to reflect. Business as usual isn\\'t our concern right now.

The next scheduled matches are Wednesday, where there are three matches on the slate, including the North Carolina Courage playing at home.The Athletic reported that it interviewed over a dozen players who played under Riley since 2010 and others who are involved with women\\'s soccer. One former player who played for Riley on three different teams, Sinead Farrelly, described how a married Riley coerced her into his hotel room to have sex. Farrelly described being under Riley\\'s control, saying, \"I felt claimed. That word honestly describes it perfectly for me, because I have this feeling that he went around and he looked at his prospects, and he zeroed in on me. He claimed me; that\\'s what his touch felt like. I just remember thinking: \\'Is anyone else seeing this?\\' I felt under his control.\"Another reported incident describes Riley coercing Farrelly and teammate Mana Shim back to his apartment and pressuring the two to kiss each other. Shim described a time when Riley invited her to a game footage session in his hotel room and greeted her wearing only underwear. Other former players, who wished to remain unnamed, said the former coach made inappropriate remarks about weight and sexual orientations.The Athletic asked Riley to comment on his alleged misconduct, to which he replied the former players\\' claims were \"completely untrue.\" According to The Athletic, Riley told them in an email, \"I have never had sex with, or made sexual advances towards these players.\"In his denials to The Athletic, Riley said, \"there\\'s a chance I\\'ve said something along the way that offended someone,\" but did not \"belittle\" players. Riley also denied reviewing game footage in his hotel room.Riley coached the Portland Thorns from 2014-2015, the Western New York Flash in 2016 and the Courage after the Flash dissolved and the franchise rights were sold to a group in North Carolina. He was coach of the year in 2017 and 2018.Governing bodies to investigateUS Soccer said Friday it will hire someone to conduct an independent investigation of the allegations. \"We take seriously our responsibility to vigorously investigate the abhorrent behavior that has been reported and gain a full and frank understanding of the factors that allowed it to happen,\" officials said in a statement.

Kerry said the more than 40 ministers who attended the pre-COP26 event in Milan were \"engaged\" in discussions to make the Glasgow talks a success.Global leaders are expected to strengthen their commitments to addressing the climate crisis ahead of the Glasgow event. Dozens of countries failed to meet a July 31 deadline to update their pledges to slash emissions, as they are required to do under the 2015 Paris Agreement. There is still a significant gap between what leaders are promising and what\\'s needed by 2030.US climate action is on the line as negotiations in Congress reach a fever pitch\"The bottom line is, folks, that as we stand here today we believe we can make enormous progress in Glasgow, moving rapidly towards the new goals that the science is telling us we must achieve,\" Kerry said in Milan. \"We have to achieve somewhere in the vicinity of a 45% reduction over the next 10 years and this is the decisive decade so we still have 30 days to work and we will continue to work.\"Read MoreA report from the United Nations\\' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in August showed that the world is warming faster than scientists previously thought and that slashing greenhouse gas emissions by at least half this decade is crucial to staving off the more catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis.The IPCC report said the world has already rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees -- a critical threshold that world leaders agreed warming should remain below to avoid worsening impacts.What is COP26? How the pivotal UN conference could avert global climate \\'catastrophe\\'COP26 President Alok Sharma, a British lawmaker, said that there was consensus among ministers to do more to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius target within reach and meeting a $100 billion-a-year pledge to help the most vulnerable nations tackle climate change.\"We need to deliver on the $100 billion a year, and I have said many times before, and I repeat again, that delivering on the $100 billion is absolutely a matter of trust,\" Sharma said. Kerry added that the US government is working to decarbonize its entire power sector by 2035, adding that President Joe Biden is \"greatly seized\" by this issue. \"By 2030, 50% of the vehicles sold in the United States are going to be electric and General Motors and Ford, big companies, have joined together to join in that. By 2035 the target is to no longer be using and selling internal combustion engine vehicles,\" Kerry said. \"We will shift to an economy based on electric. Those are ambitious goals, they are big goals but they\\'re do-able and the private sector is joining into these kinds of initiatives,\" he added. Kerry\\'s tone was more diplomatic than comments made earlier in the week, when he called on world leaders to \"stop the B.S.\" and commit to the terms of the Paris Agreement.\"We are behind and we have to stop the B.S. that is being thrown at us by a number of countries that have not been willing to sign up to what Great Britain have signed up to, we have signed up to, Japan, Canada the EU.

The Belarusian capital of Minsk was thronged with massive protests before and after the disputed presidential election in August 2020, which was marred by fraud. Lukashenko says he won anyway, but the US, EU and Belarusian opposition challenge that.But when CNN sat down for a rare interview with the man responsible for a brutal crackdown over the last year, he was defiant, alternately denying facts or claiming things were worse in the United States or Britain.Demonstrators carried pre-Soviet white and red Belarus flags last October as they demanded Lukashenko resign after months of mass protests.Challenged on human rights abuses, including attacks on protesters, a bomb threat that forced a plane to land allowing Belarusian authorities to arrest dissidents on board, and what the European Union calls the \"weaponization\" of migrants, Lukashenko tried to deflect anything negative. JUST WATCHEDHear stories from the border of Europe\\'s last dictatorshipReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear stories from the border of Europe\\'s last dictatorship 05:59\"This is madness,\" he said of Polish government claims that Belarus was dumping migrants on their border. \"Are you taking me for a madman?\" he said when asked if his country was transporting migrants to the edge of the European Union as revenge for EU sanctions and the EU sheltering dissidents. Read MoreBut the tension between Belarus and the EU is real. So is the fact that most airlines are no longer overflying Belarusian territory. That action was triggered when a vocal critic of Lukashenko\\'s regime was taken into custody in May from a Ryanair plane heading from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania.The Ryanair flight was allowed to resume its journey to Vilnius after two dissidents were removed from the plane.A Belarusian fighter jet intercepted the passenger plane in Belarus airspace as it was told to make an emergency landing in Minsk by local air traffic controllers who said they feared there was a bomb on board. Once on the ground, Belarusian authorities arrested exiled dissident journalist Roman Protasevich alongside his Russian girlfriend, before allowing the aircraft to depart. A Belarusian official claimed the Palestinian militant group Hamas had sent an email saying there was a bomb aboard the flight. A Hamas spokesman denied the allegation as \"fake news.\" Protasevich\\'s supporters said it was a fantastical ruse to get the plane on the ground in Minsk.Pressed by CNN on whether there was a genuine bomb threat or whether it had been manufactured as an excuse to arrest a critic, Lukashenko merely insisted his country followed international laws.\"If you are afraid to fly over our territory, I can personally guarantee your safety and that of your company, your country or any other country when flying over Belarus, just as ever before,\" Lukashenko told CNN. \"If you choose not to fly, that\\'s fine, OK, fly over the North Pole or the South Pole, that is your right, I cannot force you. I\\'m not as powerful as Great Britain, let alone the United States, to dictate any terms. If you don\\'t fly, others will, as you\\'ve just said. That\\'s fine, we\\'ll get by.\" Lukashenko makes a victory sign for his supporters after the disputed 2020 election.Lukashenko, a temperamental former collective farm boss, has been president of Belarus since 1994, its first and only leader since the fall of the Soviet Union. Called \"Europe\\'s last dictator,\" his iron grip on his country has become increasingly forceful, especially since last year\\'s vote. His public appearances are tightly controlled and he is generally surrounded by fawning countrymen. At the CNN interview in the Palace of Independence, he weaved and ducked, attempting to turn the issues onto the West. Confronted with details of some of the victims of the harsh, even deadly, treatment of those against him, he said he had nothing to apologize for. \"I don\\'t think this is even a relevant question, and in principle, I have nothing to apologize for,\" he said.   CNN cited evidence from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of some detainees reporting injuries including broken bones and burns, while others said they were forced to lie naked in dirt while being assaulted.  Lukashenko responded: \"You know, we don\\'t have a single detention center, as you say, like Guantanamo, or those bases that the United States and your country created in Eastern Europe ... As regards our own detention centers, where we keep those accused or those under investigation, they are no worse than in Britain or the United States. I can guarantee you that.\"He brought up the death of Ashli Babbitt, shot and killed as she tried to crawl through a broken window leading to the Speaker\\'s Lobby during the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, falsely saying CNN and others \"keep quiet about it.\" He first seemed reluctant to even say the name of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who left Belarus after the election that was widely seen as fraudulent. Then he said Tikhanovskaya had not had to flee. \"I swear by my children that Tikhanovskaya was not fleeing anywhere,\" he said.US President Joe Biden meets with Svetlana Tikhanovskaya in the White House in July.Tikhanovskaya is regarded by Europe and the United States as having had the election stolen from her.

Most did not stop to speak to CNN and quickly hurried away. One young man who did talk gave a blunt assessment of why people were scared. \"This is Belarus,\" he said. \"The police can arrest you and me.\" Lukashenko, here with troops near the Polish and Ukrainian borders, paints himself as a strongman.Back in Independence Palace, Lukashenko said his people understood him. That he was joking when he said coronavirus could be warded off with a shot of vodka and a sauna. He cultivates an image as a man of the people, a strong leader and a maverick on the world stage. But still, he watches what he says.\"I am not going to admit to anything in front of you. I am not under investigation. So please choose your words carefully,\" he said In one answer.He veered between not being a \"weakling\" who would care about having revenge against the EU for sanctions, to threatening reprisals should relations with the West deteriorate further. Lukashenko attended a hockey match with his ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin,  in Sochi, Russia, in 2020. But it is weakness that his critics say is pushing Lukashenko ever closer to another strongman next door, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in financial aid -- Kremlin support that is likely to come with strings. The closer economic, political, and military integration has fueled speculation that Lukashenko will be the last as well as the first Belarusian President, effectively merging his country with Russia. In one breath, he denies this. \"Putin and I are intelligent enough to create a union of two independent states that would be stronger together than separate. Sovereignty is not for sale,\" he said. In the next breath, he suggests what could happen if there\\'s provocation. \"If we need to, Belarus will turn into one military base for Russia and Belarus in order to withstand your aggression, if you decide, or if any one country decides to attack. And you should be clear on this, I have never made any secret of it.\" CNN\\'s Katharina Krebs contributed to this story.',\n",

Two more weeks of Covid-19 quarantine would be too much, Scott Morrison said on Friday, claiming that while there are \"a lot of international interests,\" the most important audience for his yet-to-be-unveiled climate plan remains at home.\"My first and most important group that I need to talk to about our plan is not overseas. It\\'s right here in Australia,\" he said. \"It\\'s talking to people in regional Australia, how the deputy prime minister and I believe our plan will help them in their communities, how our plan will help them realize their future.\" With that remark, Morrison made it clear his loyalty lies with Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, a cowboy hat-wearing, former accountant who leads the National Party, the Liberal government\\'s coalition partner -- and not with international allies who are urging Australia to take greater action to cut emissions.Australian Prime Minister says Australia will reach net zero \"as soon as possible\".Joyce says he wants to see the numbers before he agrees to any new climate targets, as he struggles to unite a party riven with differences over Australia\\'s future relationship with coal.Read MoreMorrison\\'s refusal to commit to a target of net zero emissions by 2050 hasn\\'t just isolated him on the international stage. Even within Australia\\'s own borders -- aside from staunch pro-coal Nationals -- Morrison is looking more and more like he\\'s being left behind.On Friday, even the Minerals Council of Australia, the country\\'s mining advocacy group, announced it supported net zero emissions by 2050. The country\\'s largest states have already announced large emission reduction targets, and surveys also show most Australian people support tougher climate action. Will Stefan, emeritus professor at the Australian National University\\'s Fenner School of Environment and Society, said public opinion appeared to contradict the interests of Morrison\\'s political allies and big business, who invest heavily in fossil fuels.\"I think there\\'s a growing gulf between what the Australian public wants and how our Prime Minister is behaving,\" he said.And that\\'s a dangerous position for a Prime Minister to be in just months before a federal election.Photovoltaic modules at a solar farm on the outskirts of Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia.Selling Kodak camerasPart of the reason for Morrison\\'s reluctance to take actions lies in the fact that he leads a coalition made up of the center-right, pro-business Liberal Party and the National Party, who traditionally advocate for regional workers and agricultural communities. The National Party has long opposed any action on climate change, claiming it will hurt rural communities. Joyce wants assurances the party\\'s traditional supporters won\\'t lose out in any broader transition to renewable energy. \"It\\'s the little old bush accountant saying that lots of clients have ideas, but (you need) to sit down with them and say, \\'Okay, that\\'s your idea, let\\'s prudently go about this,\\'\" Joyce told told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).  He said whole towns rely on Australia\\'s coal industry, and they shouldn\\'t be forgotten.\"It\\'s not just those farms, not just the mines, it is the towns that are attached to the commerce of those industries,\" he said. \"It is the hairdressers, the tire business. These people also rely on the Nationals to make sure that we don\\'t pull the economic rug out from underneath them.\"Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce during Question Time in the House of Representatives at Parliament House on June 23 in Canberra, Australia.While some Nationals support a move to net zero, others seem unlikely to budge, much to the frustration of some of Morrison\\'s Liberal Party colleagues who want greater climate action.On Sunday, a coal-loving Nationals senator took to Twitter to say he was \"deadset against net zero.\" A Liberal minister hit back, accusing him of \"selling Kodak cameras ... when the iPhone is coming.\"The divisions are making life difficult for Morrison, who said he\\'s working on a plan to bring his government \"together on this issue.\"It\\'s not clear when that plan will be released, but he has said it\\'ll be ready before other leaders descend on Glasgow for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 as it is the 26th UN conference on climate change.Despite being one of the largest per capita emitters of carbon in the world, according to the World Bank, the Australian government has dragged its feet on climate change action for decades.The steelworks and coal loading facility in Port Kembla in Wollongong, Australia.Australia\\'s pledge to reduce its carbon emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2030 is far below commitments from similar developed nations, including the United States.  And Morrison has steadfastly refused to commit to net zero by 2050, saying only the country will reach the goal \"as soon as possible.\" Morrison\\'s government has insisted that Australia is meeting its climate targets -- and even beating them -- but Stefan said the emission reduction target was \"very weak.\"Experts have previously said Australia would need to cut its emissions by twice the current commitment, up to 50% by 2050, to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius worldwide. And even greater cuts are needed to keep warming below the international target of 1.5 degrees Celsius.\"They\\'re talking about new technologies and so on, but they\\'re avoiding, completely avoiding the way we can get our emissions down, rapidly at cost and with side benefits. And that\\'s to go renewable,\" said Stefan.Part of the trouble is Australia is heavily reliant on mining for its economic prosperity. The country is one of the world\\'s biggest coal exporters, bringing in around 50 billion Australian dollars ($36 billion) and employing more than 50,000 people, according to the government.Australia is one of the world\\'s biggest coal exporters.With coal prices surging, some Nationals see no reason to cut off a lucrative source of revenue.But the rival argument is that Australia has an opportunity to generate masses of renewable energy and industries to replace jobs lost in fossil fuels. On Wednesday, as he announced plans to halve the state\\'s emissions by 2030, New South Wales Environment Minister Matt Kean said Australia should \"lead the world\" on climate change, describing it as the \"biggest economic opportunity of our lifetime.\" \"The reality is that the world is changing rapidly ... We would be absolutely mad to miss it,\" he said.What the Australian people wantSome politicians have pitched Australia\\'s climate divide as a city versus country debate that will see the latter lose out.In an opinion piece published Monday, Nationals Sen. Bridget McKenzie accused her Liberal Party colleagues of forgetting about rural Australians and miners whose jobs would be lost by tough action on climate change.At a press conference with the Liberal Party\\'s deputy leader, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, on a separate issue Wednesday, the two traded jabs over the government\\'s climate policies.When Frydenberg said \"climate change has no postcode,\" McKenzie responded by saying some Liberal Party politicians were trying to be \"cool\" by pushing for climate action. \"Josh isn\\'t one of them,\" she added.While politicians argue over the best way forward, rural Australians are getting on with it. They say they have no choice.Ellen Litchfield, a third-generation farmer, said rural and urban communities have more in common than some politicians seem to think.With her family, third-generation farmer Ellen Litchfield operates Wilpoorinna, a sheep and cattle station 650 kilometers (400 miles) north of Adelaide in the Australian Outback, making her acutely aware of the threat of droughts to her and farmers like her.She said the idea that there was a divide between rural and urban voters was mostly cooked up by politicians, capitalizing on a nostalgia for rural Australia, to argue for the status quo.\"I think that there\\'s a lot more in common with the regional voter and the urban voter than they want us to believe,\" she said. Litchfield, who advocates for Farmers for Climate Action, said many regional workers see \"the benefits of changing.\"\"Mind the pun, but we\\'re at the coalface of climate change every day. We\\'re working out in the environment, we\\'re seeing how things change,\" she said. \"And feeling supported and like we are all working together, all the industries are working together to secure the future, would be a huge benefit for us.\"It isn\\'t just Litchfield who supports climate change action in Australia.Protesters take part in the School Strike 4 Climate rally on May 21 in Melbourne, Australia.A poll by Essential Polling released on August 17 found more than 60% of respondents supported providing greater funding for solar power, introducing a carbon levy on polluters and putting in place a net zero carbon emissions target by 2030.ANU professor Stefan said government efforts to reduce emissions in some jurisdictions, such as his home in the nation\\'s capital, Canberra, had been popular with the electorate.\"This is a global problem, and we\\'re all expected to do our fair share,\" he said.Whether Morrison can come up with a plan to balance the competing forces in his coalition remains to be seen.But whatever compromise he can offer will be pored over at length by the international community -- and by all Australians with votes to cast the next election.

              " ' (CNN)Ukrainian hockey authorities have been widely criticized for the lenient punishment it handed out to one of the league\\'s players for performing a racist gesture. The incident occurred on September 26 during a match between HC Kremenchuk and HC Donbass, when Kremenchuk player Andriy Deniskin mimed peeling and eating a banana in the direction of black Donbass player Jalen Smereck.In cooperation with the Ukrainian Hockey League (UHL), the Disciplinary Committee of the Ukrainian Ice Hockey Federation handed Deniskin a 13-game suspension, but under UHL rules the player or his club is able to buy out 10 games of the ban for $187.80 each game. Nazem Kadri, a player for the National Hockey League\\'s Colorado Avalanche, labeled the punishment and the handling of the incident as \"pathetic.\"\"What a fumble by the Ukrainian league to allow a player to buy his games back after a vulgar and unacceptable action,\" he wrote on Twitter. Read More\"Pathetic mishandle by who ever is in charge. Obviously they tolerate this kind of behaviour, it\\'s a shame.\" The UHL did not respond to CNN\\'s request for comment, but in a statement at the time of the incident said that \"such behavior of hockey players on the site is unacceptable within a civilized society.\"  After the match, Deniskin apologized to Smereck in an Instagram post.\"I want to publicly apologize to the player of the hockey club Donbass Jalen Smereck,\" he wrote. \"During the match Kremenchuk - Donbass, I, being in negative emotions, showed a gesture that someone may consider as an insult in race.\"I respect all people regardless of their race or nationality. Emotions in hockey, unfortunately, can be different.\"Speaking to the press after the incident, Deniskin said he regrets the incident \"because I am not a racist.\"\"I made this negative gesture on emotion after the fight, but at that moment I did not have any racist intentions,\" he added.\"Only afterwards I realized that I could have made Jalen look bad with my ill-considered action. So, once again, I want to express my apologies to him. I respect all people regardless of their racial or national origin.\"I am very sorry to what has happened because I treat all people equally.\"CNN reached out to Deniskin through Kremenchuk, but is yet to hear back.After the match, Donbass said in a statement it was \"outraged by the behavior\" of Deniskin.\"[The] Donetsk club rejects any racist manifestations -- racism has no place neither on the sports fields, nor outside them,\" it wrote.\"We will do everything possible to support our hockey player, while at the same time we call the Disciplinary Committee for the strictest possible punishment for the Kremenchuk player.\"Donbass head coach Pavel Mikulchik said Smereck was \"in a depressed state\" following the incident.\"You should see in what condition he came today,\" he told the Donbass website. \"He could not start the training process.

That\\'s the farthest I\\'ve ever seen it go.\"In an Instagram post, Smereck wrote \"these situations are very tough and I\\'m a big believer in standing up for what is right.

On and OFF the ice.\"The HDA is an organization comprised of current and former NHL players that aims to eradicate racism and intolerance in hockey. It said it \"stands with Jalen\" and has been in contact with him.\"The hockey community rallies around him and this is just another example showcasing how hockey is NOT for everyone,\" it wrote on Twitter. \"The higher-ups must stand up and make the right decision.

According to her statement, the evidence collected suggested the person responsible could have been an officer in the police division of the military at the time of the crimes, and investigators were able to isolate the perpetrator\\'s DNA profile. Read MoreThe 59-year-old man, who lived in the south of France, was told on September 24 that he would be examined on Wednesday as part of the investigation. Around 750 men serving as military police officers in the Paris region at the time of the crimes were called in for examination.Sarah Everard\\'s murderer kidnapped her using police ID and handcuffsThe prosecutor said the man was reported missing by his wife on Monday and found dead in the southern commune of Le Grau-du-Roi two days later, the day of his scheduled examination. Beccuau said he had initially been part of the military\\'s police division before joining the police force, and was retired at the time of his death. Although the prosecutor did not name the man in her statement, CNN affiliate BFMTV said a source close to the investigation had named him as Fran챌ois Verove. Citing local media, BFMTV said Verove left a suicide note confessing he was a murderer but did not give the names of his victims. However, he said he had \"gotten a grip\" on himself and hadn\\'t \"done anything since 1997.\"Former police chief Christian Flaesch, who investigated the 1986 rape and murder of 11-year-old C챕cile Bloch, linked Verove to the crime in an interview with BFMTV Friday and said new technologies had facilitated the breakthrough in the case. BFMTV also said the man was suspected of murdering 20-year-old Irmgard Mueller and 38-year-old Gilles Politi in 1987. A French woman was shot and burned by her estranged husband, officials say, as anger builds over femicidesThe suspect was nicknamed \"Le Gr챗l챕,\" or \"The Pockmarked Man\" in local media, after the Bloch family described a man they saw in their corridor around the time of C챕cile\\'s murder, according to BFMTV.Citing Le Parisien, BFMTV said the man had served in the cavalry of the Republican Guard from 1983 to 1988 before becoming part of the regular police force and serving in the juvenile squad in charge of minors. Local news outlet Le Midi Libre said Verove had joined the local council in the southern commune of Prades-le-Lez in 2019, citing former mayor Jean-Marc Lussert. \"I feel both satisfaction and also pain for the Bloch family,\" Bernard Pasqualini, former investigator in charge of the case in 1986, said in an interview with BFMTV on Thursday. \"This man will go unpunished.\"The news comes the same week as former UK police officer Wayne Couzens was given a whole-life sentence for the kidnapping, rape and murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard after using his police identification to carry out a false arrest.

              " ' (CNN)With nearly three quarters of all adults fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the European Union is a world leader in inoculations. But the impressive headline number is obscuring an uncomfortable reality: the rollout has been extremely unequal across the union.Some countries, including Ireland, Malta, Portugal and Denmark, have achieved near universal vaccination, boasting coverage rates of around 90%, according to the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC). On the other side of the bloc, Romania and Bulgaria have fully vaccinated only 33% and 22% of their adults, respectively.The problem isn\\'t down to vaccine shortages. All EU countries have access to all of the shots approved by the EU -- Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson. Individual countries are also free to get other shots. Hungary, for example, has acquired Russian Sputnik vaccines for its population.  \"They have the vaccines. Anybody who wants to get vaccinated can,\" Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian political scientist and a founding board member of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN. Instead, Krastev said, Bulgaria struggles with deep-seated vaccine hesitancy that is fueled by political instability, conspiracy theories and a lack of faith in the authorities.Read More\"There\\'s high level of mistrust, and that goes both for Bulgaria and Romania,\" he said. \"Even the medical community, doctors, nurses, many are hesitant to get vaccinated, so it\\'s not a surprise that the society as a whole is too,\" he said.Both Romania and Bulgaria have been battling spikes in new coronavirus cases since early September. Romania has reported over 45,000 new cases and more than 800 deaths in the week to Sunday, about the same level it saw at the peak of its second wave of the epidemic in April. The ECDC warned Thursday that states with low vaccination rates are risking surges in hospitalizations and deaths this fall if they relax social distancing measures. \"In such a scenario, due to very high virus circulation, fully vaccinated vulnerable populations are also at risk of experiencing infection with a severe outcome,\" the ECDC said in its latest Covid-19 risk assessment, urging the countries that are struggling with inoculations to try to understand why their population remain hesitant and then address those issues. Pockets of low vaccine uptake remain in Europe. Here\\'s how 4 countries are dealing with themBulgaria is holding its third parliamentary election this year in November. Two previous votes, in April and then in July, ended in a stalemate, with no government formed. As a result, the country is stuck in a perpetual election campaign with little room for anything else. \"There has been much more election campaigning than vaccine campaigning,\" Krastev said. \"Neither the government that was in power nor the caretaker government made vaccination a priority.\"Krastev said the issue of vaccines hadn\\'t divided Bulgarian society along partisan lines, because most people were generally united in their distrust of the political class. \"The US has a major level of polarization; here it\\'s not so much political polarization, but confusion and disgust with anything political that very much hurt the success of the [vaccination] campaign,\" he told CNN. Allegations of government corruption sparked widespread protests across Bulgaria last year. Police reacted with violence that shocked the nation -- and made people even more suspicious of the authorities. The media also played a role, Krastev said. \"In order to make the debate more interesting, they would present the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine opinions as equally valuable, so people get confused,\" he said.A healthcare worker is waiting for patients at a Covid-19 vaccination centre at The Military Medical Academy in Sofia.The Romanian government has blamed its poor vaccination rollout on fake news and conspiracy theories that are being spread online. There are also stark inequalities within both countries. Roma communities in Romania and Bulgaria are among the least vaccinated. Dimitar Dimitrov, the director of the Roma Program at the Open Society Institute in Sofia, said the problem is down to strained relationships between the communities and wider society.\"Many Roma neighborhoods in Bulgaria have been subject to lockdowns without proper [explanation] even though the level of infections in other parts of the same municipalities has been higher. So this attitude from institutions towards Roma people and Roma neighborhoods shows why Roma don\\'t trust institutions,\" Dimitrov told CNN. Dimitrov said many people, especially in rural areas, might also find it difficult to access vaccination clinics. \"If you have to get a bus or train and travel 100 kilometers to get to the hospital and then wait in the line, that takes time and money. The vaccination itself is free but to get to the vaccination point costs money,\" Dimitrov said. The Romanian government recently announced it would put extra resources into ensuring people who can\\'t access clinics are able to get the shots -- for example by requesting a doctor to visit them at home. The East-West divideBut Bulgaria and Romania aren\\'t the only ones facing a hesitancy problem. The European Union appears to be divided into two parts. One half has embraced inoculation and got almost everyone immunized. The other is struggling to convince large numbers amid deep mistrust in the vaccines.The dividing line sits roughly along the Iron Curtain boundary that once split Europe into East and West.Of the bloc\\'s 27 member states, the 15 top performers in terms of inoculation rates are all part of what used to be the Western bloc, while the bottom 10 are all former Communist countries. Greece and Lithuania are the only two countries bucking the trend, with Lithuania placing 16th and Greece 17th. All of the former Western countries, with the exception of Greece, have fully vaccinated at least 70% of their adults. None of the Eastern states have reached that threshold yet. Krastev said the way the pandemic unfolded across different countries could be one factor explaining the differences. \"The countries that got hit by the first wave more, in 2020, when the shock was stronger, countries like Italy or Spain, they have more success with vaccination in general than the countries that were hit by the second wave,\" he said, adding that the Bulgarian government never managed to convince people that a high vaccination rate was a top priority. \"Instead it became the matter of national pride that we never had lockdown,\" he said. Anna Nici흦ska, an assistant professor at the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of Warsaw, has studied the reasons for vaccine hesitancy and said that history also plays a major role in influencing people\\'s decisions. Nici흦ska and her colleagues looked at data on trust in health care systems and medical authorities from 100 countries and found that mistrust was much higher in nations that had experienced Soviet-style communism in the past. People who had had firsthand experience of being lied to by their governments struggled to trust the authorities, even years after revolution, she explained. The longer people lived under communism, the higher the mistrust. \\'A Band-Aid over a gaping hole\\': Booster shots for the rich world won\\'t end the pandemic, experts warn\"People exposed to Soviet Communism are less trustful in other people, the government and also the health care systems, [the experience] instills mistrust in the public domain and [anything] formal,\" she said. Nici흦ska said this was one reason why strict vaccine requirements may not lead to significantly higher uptakes in such countries.\"A vaccination decision is based on trust and making it compulsory would be counterproductive, you have to remember that in many countries there\\'s a long tradition of resistance towards the state, so people would find a way to avoid compulsory vaccination.\"The European Commission has acknowledged the low vaccination rates in some of its member states as an issue.\"As long as the virus is not defeated in all member states, the virus is simply not defeated,\" a Commission spokesperson told CNN in a statement. The Commission said countries that are struggling to boost vaccination levels should focus on campaigns specifically targeting those who are hesitant, and stress the importance of science.',\n",

The twins enjoyed successful volleyball careers, representing South Korea in international competitions, until they were anonymously accused of bullying previous teammates at their school.After the allegations surfaced in February, they publicly apologized on their Instagram accounts, which have since been deleted. Both also said that they wished to meet with their former schoolmates to apologize for their actions.However, the twins said in a TV interview with Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) in July that they were suing the alleged victims for defamation because the claims included \"lies and false information.\" Jae-yeong and Da-yeong were released by club side Incheon Heungkuk Life Insurance Pink Spiders in June when fans protested against the Pink Spiders\\' attempt to register the sisters on the roster.Read MoreFans sent trucks with mounted LED screens showing statements that read \"Comeback of the school bullies that everyone except Heungkuk Life Insurance is against\" to multiple locations, including the Heungkuk Life Insurance company headquarters in Seoul. In February, the Pink Spiders had confirmed it would suspend the pair for an indefinite amount of time, while the Korea Volleyball Association (KVA) dropped them from the national team ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.With free-agent status, the sisters chose to continue their volleyball careers in Greece.The players needed International Transfer Certificates (ITCs) issued by the KVA to transfer to an international club, but the association sternly refused, citing its own regulation which limits international transfers of those who have severely damaged the volleyball community or caused public controversy with \"disgraceful acts.\"\"We told Federation Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) and the Greek team that we cannot agree with the [twins\\'] international transfer according to our regulation that players who caused public controversy cannot transfer internationally,\" the KVA told CNN.The KVA said it had received two messages from the FIVB asking for a bank account number to receive the solidarity fee from the twin sisters\\' transfer.When South Korean volleyball players transfer to an international club, the association receives 5% to 10% of the salary from the purchasing club.\"We didn\\'t provide our bank account information because we will not receive the fee,\" the association said. \"This is not a matter of money.\"As the KVA maintained its stance until the given deadline, the FIVB confirmed to CNN that it has officially issued ITCs for the twins \"as per the procedures under the FIVB Sports Regulations that allow ITCs to be approved without the consent of the National Federation.\"The KVA also confirmed Jae-yeong and Da-yeong\\'s transfer to PAOK Thessaloniki.

However, one of the alleged victims said in a TV interview with Korean broadcasting station MBC on Tuesday that she felt powerless that the sisters are heading to Greece while the bullying scandal remains unresolved. Her face was not shown and her voice was altered to guard her anonymity.

              " ' (CNN)London\\'s Metropolitan Police has issued advice to women approached by lone police officers in the wake of Sarah Everard\\'s murder, including telling them to run \"into a house,\" \"wave down a bus\" or call the police on 999 if they do not believe the officer is \"who they say they are\" after questioning them.Prosecutors said Everard was walking to her London home on March 3 when serving police officer Wayne Couzens used his police identification and handcuffs to deceive her into getting in his car under the pretense that she had violated Covid-19 rules. He raped her and strangled her with his police belt later that evening.Couzens was sentenced Thursday to a whole-life prison term, which is very rare in the United Kingdom and reserved for exceptionally serious crimes. It means the defendant is never considered for parole.In a press briefing on Thursday, Assistant Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police Nick Ephgrave said: \"The majority of Metropolitan Police officers patrol and conduct their duty in uniform in the company of other police officers.\"He added that while officers do sometimes patrol in plain clothes, plain clothes officers are \"almost invariably ... deployed in pairs or in larger groups.\"Read MoreMurder of young teacher makes women in London worry it could have been them\"It is very unusual for a plain clothes police officer to be deployed on their own, and even more unusual for them to engage with a member of the public on their own,\" Ephgrave said.The Met added in a written statement made Thursday that if someone is approached by a single plain clothes officer, they should \"seek further reassurance of that officer\\'s identify and intentions,\" by asking \"some very searching questions of that officer.\"The questions recommended are: \"Where are your colleagues? Where have you come from? Why are you here?, and exactly why are you stopping or talking to me?\"The statement added those approached should \"try to seek some independent verification of what they say, if they have a radio ask to hear the voice of the operator, even ask to speak through the radio to the operator to say who you are and for them to verify you are with a genuine officer, acting legitimately.\"Fury as London police officers break up vigil to murdered Sarah Everard\"If after all of that you feel in real and imminent danger and you do not believe the officer is who they say they are, for whatever reason, then I would say you must seek assistance -- shouting out to a passer-by, running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down or if you are in the position to do so calling 999.\"However, the Met has come under criticism from some women\\'s rights groups and opposition MPs for the advice.\"The statement from the Met, and this advice in particular shows a fundamental lack of insight into the issue of women\\'s safety with the police. It doesn\\'t even recognize the huge power imbalance between a police officer and someone they are arresting,\" the Women\\'s Equality Party said on Twitter.A local Liberal Democrat councilor in the borough of Sutton in London, Jenny Batt, tweeted: \"That the Met has issued this advice shows how far they have failed & how much trust & legitimacy they have lost amongst women. Information coming out about Couzens & his interactions with other officers compounding this. We need a complete overhaul of police vetting procedures.\"\"Following his arrest, as the public would expect, we reviewed [Couzens\\'] vetting. This review confirmed he passed vetting processes. However, it also found one of a range of checks may not have been undertaken correctly,\" the Met said in a press release on Thursday.Police officer jailed for breaking Black man\\'s knee in \\'clear case of racial profiling\\'Opposition Labour MP Angela Rayner, tweeted in response to the advice: \"What is going on at the top of the Metropolitan Police? Give me strength.\"The UK government\\'s crime and policing minister on Friday also said people should question a plain clothes officer and if in doubt, call the police, as the service reckons with a wave of public distrust in the wake of Sarah Everard\\'s murder. Speaking to Sky News, Kit Malthouse said: \"If anybody has any doubts about a police officer, then obviously they should question the officer about what they\\'re doing and why they\\'re doing it. If there are any doubts at all, they should ask to either speak to the control room using the officer\\'s radio, or if in doubt, call 999 and ask a question.\"Officers \"rarely deploy singly\" and it would be \"perfectly reasonable\" for anyone approached by a lone officer to \"seek reassurance,\" he said. \"I\\'m afraid that\\'s where we\\'ve got to,\" he added. The minister also defended Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick who is under pressure to resign given the misconduct in the force under her watch, particularly in its handling of Everard\\'s case and the police\\'s response.',\n",
              " ' (CNN)You don\\'t get to be the world No. 1-ranked chess player without plotting multiple moves ahead.\"I have a simple rule in life, if you are to fight the champ in anything -- do it virtually,\" quipped Magnus Carlsen in a tweet after it was announced a 10-year-old app version of himself was going to take on former world champion boxer Manny Pacquiao in a charity chess match on October 1.A keen chess player, Pacquiao is also all too aware of the challenge he\\'s facing. \"I\\'ve fought some tough opponents in the ring, but I\\'ve never faced anyone like @magnuscarlsen in a game of chess,\" said Pacquiao.Ever since he beat former world champion Anatoli Karpov to clinch the title of grandmaster at the age of 13, Norwegian Carlsen has become known for the psychological edge he has over his competitors.Read More\"I think being mentally flexible is very important during the game,\" Carlsen tells CNN Sport. The Norwegian, along with Anish Giri and Polish prodigy Jan-Krzysztof Duda, was reflecting on the secret to becoming a chess grandmaster.\"The conditions will shift during the game, something you thought was right may not turn out to be right, the situation changes from attacking [to] defending,\" added Carlsen.\"So being able to endure those changes without losing your focus and also kind of without losing your composure is very, very important.\"Giri is the No. 1-ranked Dutch chess player. Like Carlsen, he believes that having the ability to maintain concentration for long periods of time, and stay mentally agile, is the key to success in the chess arena. \"Concentration is very, very important during the game [...] because the thing with chess is that it\\'s very unforgiving,\" Giri tells CNN Sport.\"Just a few seconds of lost concentration and one rash decision could sort of ruin the whole game.\"And so it\\'s important to just maintain the concentration throughout and for that you need, of course, mental stability.\"No.1-ranked Dutch chess player Anish Giri (left) says staying mentally agile is the key to becoming a grandmaster.A spark of ambitionCarlsen has early memories of dedicating hours of practice to the sport.  By the age of five, his father had taught him how to play chess, but it wasn\\'t until later that his hobby became a fully-fledged craft. When he finished primary school, he spent the following year traveling across Europe to play chess, collecting multiple accolades and eventually earning the top spot in the International Chess Federation (FIDE) rating list in 2010. \"Growing up, I always had to play against stronger players than me,\" Carlsen says. \"But something happened when I was 16, 17 years old. I was playing against the best players in the world, my mentality changed a bit.\"So now, I need to be like, the strongest. I need to have the toughest mentality in order to get the better of them. And I think after I changed that mindset, I went from being one of the best players to somebody who could actually actually be the best.\"Playing against opponents who had more experience than Carlsen certainly paid off. In 2012, he won the London Chess Championship for the third time, but he rose to fame that same year, when his rating increased to 2861, breaking Russian legend Garry Kasparov\\'s record of 2851 -- which had remained unbeaten since 1999. Carlsen\\'s stellar run was a precursor to his most momentous achievement to date, when he beat Indian chess grandmaster Viswanathan Anand to become a world champion at the age of 22. \"I think there are a lot of factors that can decide whether you will become a very strong chess player, even a grandmaster or one of the top players in the world,\" he says.\"For me, personally, it\\'s been about putting in the time, obviously. And for me, I don\\'t think I ever could have gotten far in chess without the grade levels again, that\\'s been what\\'s been driving it for me [...] all of these years, and as soon as I lose that, I would quit.\"Magnus Carlsen (right) beat India\\'s Viswanathan Anand (left) during the Chess World Championship match to become a world champion at age 22 in Chennai, India.Chasing a coveted prizeHaving conquered the world of chess, Carlsen is now chasing the first ever NFT trophy in the sport\\'s history.The coveted prize will be presented to the winner of the Champions Chess Tour 2021, which sees the most-skilled players in the world compete across ten tournaments of rapid chess.\"NFTs are certainly something I\\'ve known about for a while. A lot of my friends are into crypto, so they were talking about that quite a long time ago, and I feel like it\\'s really interesting that the tour is now incorporating those into the event. And then we\\'ll see what the interest is. But certainly, for me it\\'s going to be a fun ride,\" Carlsen says. \"I know that the NBA with Top Shot has already really embraced the NFT market, and I do believe that more and more sports are looking into making NFTs an important part of sports memorabilia.\"As well as adding another accolade to his brimming trophy cabinet, Carlsen is also excited by the prospect of sharing his victory with his supporters.\"Fans will be able to buy a version of the Champions Chess Tour trophy as well as highlights and other chess moments from the tour. As long as I win the trophy then I\\'m very happy to share it with anybody!\" Hours of practiceFew have come as close to Carlsen\\'s luster in their chess endeavors as Giri, who became a grandmaster when he was 14 -- making him the youngest person in the world to achieve that title at the time.A four-time Dutch chess champion, he beat Carlsen in 22 moves at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in 2011. Having won numerous medals since, he is now the No.7-ranked chess player on the global stage. Like his peer, he believes that devoting time to training -- often in place of other activities -- is what separates the best players in the world from chess enthusiasts. \"To be a top chess player, you definitely put in a lot of free time. It\\'s easier to say how many hours I didn\\'t spend on chess than to say how many hours I did. I mean honestly, at some point, all my free time I was just busy with chess. Of course, I would do all the things that I had to do like I would go to school, few other things that I had to do,\" Giri says. \"My mom would ask me sometimes to clean my room or to wash the dishes or whatever it was just to keep me away from just because it was abnormal, how much time I used to spend as a kid.\"I think this is necessary also if you want to be the best at anything pretty much.\"Four-time Dutch chess champion, Giri beat Carlsen in 22 moves at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in 2011.Maintaining an equilibriumFor others, knowing that they have the ability to become a champion feels instinctive.Duda says that after he won the World U-10 Championship in 2008, he knew he would become a grandmaster. \"In general, it\\'s kind of funny, you know that when I was young [...] it was kind of very obvious to me that one day I will become the world champion.\" As a child, he was on course for success, undertaking six-hour practice sessions with his coach at the time. While he has since reaped the rewards, being able to maintain such focus from a young age was \"very difficult.\" \"It takes a lot of time, mostly, you have to really focus on chess and on chess only. You have to play in a lot of tournaments, think about chess all the time.\"He went on to become a grandmaster at the age of 15 and won a series of awards as a junior competitor, including the European U-14 Championship. Now ranked No. 15 in the world, he\\'s known for his creative style of play and ability to make rapid decisions.But even as a high-level competitor, Duda says that being able to disconnect from his surroundings and give his full attention to the game at hand can be challenging. From time to time, he says he punctuates his matches by standing up and walking, in order to maintain an equilibrium. \"I would say that my concentration level is probably kind of below my colleagues.\"Taking into account my age [...] I should be capable of doing one thing at a time but sometimes, you know, I like to just think about something else during the game.\"You need to find a balance, like in everything in life basically.\"\\'You have to really love the game\\'World No. 15 Duda is known for his creative style of play and ability to make rapid decisions.While all three grandmasters have followed alternative routes to success, what threads them together is their fidelity to their craft. Giri says that he has an unadulterated passion for chess which sustains his ambition, and fuels his desire to work hard.\"You have to really love the game, and that usually goes well with key qualities. You should be okay to be on your own usually, to be without other people around and not feel that you lack something, just to be fine with you, yourself and your thoughts.\"Just to immerse into something and forget about everything else.\"Carlsen agrees.\"Personally, I\\'m not 100% sure what the main skills are for a top chess player because normally when people ask me how do you do this and this and this, I don\\'t know, I\\'ve just been doing it for a long time and I\\'ll tell you why something is right, something is wrong,\" he says.\"Patience, and having the capability to be analytical [...] to learn from your mistakes is important.\"It\\'s important to make quick decisions and be able to be confident in those because they\\'re often based on fairly limited data. \"It\\'s very hard for me to say whether my skills are transferable. I think what a lot of people say is that if you play some chess, that can help you out in other parts of life.\"But if you only play chess, you will only be good at chess. So that\\'s what I know. So far I\\'ve only tried chess so that\\'s the only thing that I know that I\\'m good at.\"CNN\\'s Alvin Whitney contributed to this report. ',\n",

The league, in concert with the North Carolina Courage, has reacted swiftly in response to these new allegations, and former head coach Paul Riley has been terminated.\"Read More\"Concurrently, we are reporting these new allegations to the US Center for SafeSport for investigation. A safe and secure work environment is a top priority for the league and its collective ownership,\" Baird added.The Athletic reported that it interviewed over a dozen players who played under Riley since 2010 and others who are involved with women\\'s soccer. One former player who played for Riley on three different teams, Sinead Farrelly, described how a married Riley coerced her into his hotel room to have sex. Farrelly described being under Riley\\'s control, saying, \"I felt claimed. That word honestly describes it perfectly for me, because I have this feeling that he went around and he looked at his prospects, and he zeroed in on me. He claimed me; that\\'s what his touch felt like.

Shim described a time when Riley invited her to a game film session in his hotel room and greeted her wearing only underwear. Other former players, who wished to remain unnamed, said the former coach made inappropriate remarks about weight and sexual orientations.The Athletic asked Riley to comment on his alleged misconduct, to which he replied the former players\\' claims were \"completely untrue.\" According to The Athletic, Riley told them in an email, \"I have never had sex with, or made sexual advances towards these players.\"In his denials to The Athletic, Riley said, \"there\\'s a chance I\\'ve said something along the way that offended someone,\" but did not \"belittle\" players. Riley also denied reviewing game film in his hotel room.CNN has not been able to reach Riley independently for comment.The US Soccer Federation suspended Riley\\'s coaching license on Thursday and stated in part that, \"The abusive behavior described by the courageous athletes who have come forward is repulsive, unacceptable and has zero place in soccer or society.\"Multiple professional soccer players were outraged by the accusations, including US Women\\'s National Team and OL Reign player Megan Rapinoe, who said on Twitter on Thursday, \"Mana & Sinead you are so strong & we are with you :heart: To everyone in a position of power who let this happen, heard it & dismissed it, signed off on this monster moving to another team w/zero repercussions, F**k YOU, you\\'re all monsters, & can ALL hand your resignations in immediately.\"\"Men, protecting men, who are abusing women.

RIVM virologist Chantal Reusken told national broadcaster NOS that one of the people had \"probably contracted the virus in the Netherlands.

              " 'Vienna, Austria EU, Iranian and Russian diplomats sounded upbeat as Iran and world powers held their first talks in five months on Monday to try to save their 2015 nuclear deal, despite Tehran taking a tough stance in public that Western powers said would not work.Diplomats say time is running out to resurrect the pact, which then-US President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018 in a move which infuriated Iran and dismayed the other powers involved -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. European Union, Iranian and Russian delegates to the talks offered optimistic assessments after the new round began with a session of the remaining parties to the deal, without the United States -- whom Iran refuses to meet face-to-face.\"I feel extremely positive about what I have seen today,\" Enrique Mora, the EU official chairing the talks, said after the meeting -- the seventh round of talks aimed at reviving a deal under which Iran limited its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from US, EU and UN economic sanctions.Mora told reporters the new Iranian delegation had stuck to its demand that all sanctions be lifted. But he also suggested Tehran had not rejected outright the results of the previous six rounds of talks held between April and June.Read More\"They have accepted that the work done over the first six rounds is a good basis to build our work ahead,\" he said. \"We will be of course incorporating the new political sensibilities of the new Iranian administration.\" Russia\\'s envoy to the talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, said on Twitter they \"started quite successfully.\" Asked he if was optimistic, Iran\\'s top negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, told reporters: \"Yes, I am.\"However, it was not clear whether Iran had agreed to resume the talks where they had left off in June -- as demanded by Western powers -- or that the optimism was justified.A European diplomat struck a pessimistic note, saying the Iranians stuck to their positions and at times toughened them, which was hardly encouraging.The diplomat said matters would become clearer when detailed talks on sanctions take place on Tuesday and on nuclear issues on Wednesday.The meeting in Vienna ended a hiatus triggered by the election in June of Ebrahim Raisi, an anti-Western hardliner. The talks are effectively indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington, with other officials shuttling between them.Tehran\\'s negotiating team has set out demands that US and European diplomats consider unrealistic, Western diplomats say.Iran has adopted an uncompromising position by demanding the removal of all US and European Union sanctions imposed since 2017, including those unrelated to its nuclear program, in a verifiable process.Bagheri Kani also said Washington and its Western allies should guarantee no new sanctions would be imposed in future.\"All parties in the meeting accepted Iran\\'s demand that first the situation of illegal and unjust US sanctions ... should be cleared and then (we) discuss other issues and decide on those issues,\" he told reporters.There was no immediate comment from the big powers on Bagheri Kani\\'s remarks about the sequencing of topics.During a telephone call, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Iran\\'s Raisi \"to engage constructively\" to permit a quick return to the agreement and to keep Iran\\'s commitments to the United Nations atomic watchdog, Macron\\'s office said.Iran\\'s conflicts with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors its nuclear program, have festered.As Iran has advanced its uranium enrichment, the agency says its inspectors have been treated roughly and refused access to reinstall monitoring cameras at a site it deems essential to reviving the deal.Since Trump took the United States out of the deal, Iran has breached many of its restrictions meant to lengthen the time it would need to generate enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb. Iran says it wants to enrich uranium only for civil uses.',\n",

When the Taliban seized control in mid-August as the United States and Western allies withdrew their forces, women and girls were quickly instructed to stay home from work and school, and hundreds of the country\\'s athletes went into hiding or sought to be evacuated from the country fearing reprisals.??During the last period of Taliban rule, women were banned from participating in sports, and by late August, Khalida Popal, the former captain of the Afghan women\\'s soccer team, had urged players to delete social media profiles and burn their kits to protect themselves.  \"They are like a nightmare for my generation.

Last Wednesday, 27 people -- including a pregnant woman -- drowned in bitterly cold waters off the coast of France after an inflatable boat carrying migrants bound for Britain capsized in the English Channel.??Thousands of refugees and migrants fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in the world\\'s poorest or war-torn countries risk the dangerous crossing, often in dinghies unfit for the voyage and at the mercy of people smugglers, seeking asylum or economic opportunities in Britain. French police patrol the beach of Wimereux searching for migrants on November 25.Ministers from both sides of the Channel on Thursday laid blame on their counterparts after Wednesday\\'s tragedy, which was one of the largest losses of life in the English Channel in recent years. It is unclear whether Afghans are among those who perished, but the route is one that other Afghans have used in the past. The Afghan women players say they feel safer and more secure now they have reached the UK. \"Now we can have a calm sleep, we are less worried,\" Mayeli said.??But without the guarantee of refugee status, the young women say they feel insecure.??\"Of course, you cannot focus on studying, you cannot focus on integrating, knowing that maybe tomorrow you will be kicked out of the country,\" Popal said.??Nowrozi told CNN: \"It\\'s worrying for me that after six months the UK could say, go back to Afghanistan.\"??\"These girls, these families, the entire group have been through a lot. Their life was in great danger. They have lost a lot,\" Popal told CNN. \"They didn\\'t want to leave Afghanistan, but they were forced to. They were pushed to. They have lost so many things on the way. They were scared of their lives,\" Popal said.??\"It was not only the fear from losing their life by the Taliban, but it was from the neighborhood, from the society that were against the participation of women, especially through football,\" she said. And it wasn\\'t just the girls in danger, according to Popal: \"The brothers, and some of the fathers were threatened, beaten.??\"And there, some of them, they lost their homes. They were put on fire because the minute the Taliban took over the country, those ideologies were supported by [the] Taliban.\" The UK granted the group six months of leave to facilitate their entry to the UK, according to a Home Office official. They will be processed for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK before their six months of initial leave expires, in line with the government\\'s standard approach during and since the evacuation, according to the official.  If they are granted ILR, there will be no time limit on their ability to stay in the UK.  The future of women\\'s sport The future of women\\'s sport in Afghanistan remains unclear. Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the Taliban\\'s cultural commission, told Australia\\'s SBS News that Afghan women should not play cricket and other sports in which they would be \"exposed.\" \"In cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered. Islam does not allow women to be seen like this,\" Wasiq said to SBS News. The chairman of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, Azizullah Fazli, later told Al Jazeera that Taliban officials had indicated there was \"officially no ban on women\\'s sport,\" but many remain concerned.??Popal told CNN that the Taliban was sharing inaccurate information about the status of women to seem more progressive to the international community. Members of Afghanistan\\'s national girls football team arrive at the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) in Lahore on September 15.\"I have been receiving a lot of phone calls, messages, emails: people are desperate, especially the women athletes. They are really trying to just find a way to get out, to feel freedom, to get access to education,\" Popal said.??In October, CNN spoke to women in Kabul who were returning to public spaces after staying inside during the initial first few uncertain weeks of Taliban rule.??Still, there has been concern about a steady rollback of women\\'s freedoms since the group seized power three months ago, most recently with women barred from appearing in television dramas. \"We started playing football in a small area in a community where all of the people know us as football players. We were the women who were playing football, not only as a game, but we were playing football in order to empower other girls in order to raise our voices for women rights,\" Mayeli told CNN.??\"As a woman, as a football player, I didn\\'t feel safe in Afghanistan.\" An opportunity -- but not \"endgame\"??The young women say they are hopeful for their \"bright futures\" in the UK.??Mayeli said she is thankful to all of the people who worked to help her reach the UK, including the UK government, Popal, ROKIT (a UK-based charity that has helped the footballers) and Kim Kardashian.  \"I want to have higher education, and help other people as I can. As I have abilities, I wanna raise my voice for other girls, because they\\'re still in Afghanistan and they are in danger,\" she said.??Leeds United chairman Andrea Radrizzani, whose foundation Play for Change helped with financial assistance of the  evacuation, said he hopes one day the players can play with the Leeds United ladies team. \"Hopefully, if there is opportunity, with Yorkshire, with Leeds, we will be very happy to to have at least some of them, if not all the group. And hopefully, some of them can play with Leeds United ladies,\" he told CNN.Popal told CNN that the girls need to be given refugee status, education support, mental health and financial support. \"The main focus in the beginning is to get them mental health support, because they are traumatized. They need special care, and they have been on the go for such a long time now,\" she said. \"They have done their job. They have been through a lot, and they have risked their life to get out of Afghanistan. They have shown leadership. They have shown bravery. We need the community to come together to support the team to achieve their dreams and goals.\" Nowrozi told CNN that she wants to become a child psychologist, as she studied psychology at university in Afghanistan. And the players can\\'t wait to carry on playing football.??\"To play for Chelsea, it\\'s my ambition.\" \"I love it, because when I\\'m playing football, I feel free. I feel relaxed. At first, it was a hobby, but after that it became my love,\" she said. ',\n",

Having trailed 17-9 until the closing seconds, a thrilling comeback could have served as a much-needed spark for a downtrodden Wilson and the Seahawks. Since the eight-time Pro Bowl star returned from finger surgery -- the team has scored just 28 total points en route to three straight defeats that have left their playoff hopes in tatters.Fuller\\'s interception denied the Seahawks a shot at a dramatic comeback.It is a damning indictment of Wilson\\'s current struggles that the Seahawks scored more points in the last game before his reinstatement -- Geno Smith throwing for a pair of touchdowns and rushing for one in an impressive 31-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars -- than in the three losses since. Wilson went 20 from 31 for 247 yards and threw his first two touchdowns since returning, but it was not enough to stop him from suffering a third straight loss as the starter for the first time since he joined the Seahawks in 2012.

              " 'London (CNN)All adults in the United Kingdom will be able to get their booster Covid-19 vaccine doses three months after their second shot, the government indicated on Monday, in a dramatic acceleration of the country\\'s inoculation drive that comes amid fears over the Omicron variant.Boosters had previously only been available a minimum of six months after a second dose, for people over 40 and for over-16s with underlying health conditions.By slashing the gap to a minimum of three months, the UK will soon offer one of the smallest intervals of any country in the world. Health Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed he had accepted the move in Parliament on Monday, hours after the UK\\'s advisory body on vaccinations recommended it. England is also reinstating a mask mandate in shops and on transport from Tuesday, a move announced over the weekend that was also sparked by concerns about Omicron.The new step will heighten concerns about geographic inequalities in the effort to protect people from Covid-19 -- a disparity which was highlighted since the concerning new variant was discovered in southern Africa, where vaccination rates are lower.Vaccine inequity and hesitancy made the Omicron variant more likely, scientists sayRead More\"We\\'ve always known that a worrying new variant could be a threat to the progress that we\\'ve made as a nation,\" Javid told lawmakers. \"We\\'re learning more about this new variant all the time, but the latest indication is that it spreads very rapidly,\" he said, adding that there is \"a reasonable chance that our current vaccines may be impacted.\"The UK has so far administered 17 million booster shots, inoculating 31% of its over-12 population, according to official data. The expansion of the rollout means tens of millions are now eligible, far sooner than they initially would have been, and puts the country once again in a position separate from most nations when it comes to vaccines.Most other countries deploying boosters have invited people for a third shot six months after their second dose. The UK previously broke the mold with its initial rollout in January, when it offered first and second doses 12 weeks apart in an effort to get more people some level of protection sooner.The prospect of a new variant emerging in a part of the world where vaccination coverage is lower has been warned about for months, and led to some calls for richer countries to prioritize donating surplus doses, rather than kickstarting their booster rollouts.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), only 7.5% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Across the eight countries most affected by the travel bans related to the Omicron variant, the proportion of populations that have had at least one vaccine dose ranges from 5.6% in Malawi to 37% in Botswana.What we know and don\\'t know about the Omicron variantLabour\\'s shadow health minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, told Javid in Parliament that \"this variant is a wake-up call\" and that \"no one is safe until all of us are safe.\" She criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson\\'s government for its lack of mitigation measures and for not pressing to send doses to poorer nations.But Javid said Allin-Khan had \"misjudged the tone\" of the debate, adding: \"Surely she isn\\'t blaming the UK\\'s government for the emergence of this new variant.\"Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, told CNN on Sunday the emergence of new variants was \"a natural consequence of being too slow to vaccinate the world.\"\"We still have large unvaccinated populations, like we have across sub-Saharan Africa, and these are susceptible to big outbreaks,\" he said.CNN\\'s Ivana Kottasov찼 contributed reporting',\n",

And Vicki has so courageously shared Grace with the world in the years since, so to swim alongside her was really special.\"For Weggemann, swimming and sport in general can be \"a beacon to do something that has the power to change lives.\"For Weggemann, it\\'s a reminder of what her beloved sport of swimming can accomplish beyond the pool, medals, accolades or discussions of disabilities.\"It\\'s a reminder of how far sport can reach. That swim had nothing to do with winning or racing. It was about using sport for good and allowing it to be a beacon to do something that has the power to change lives.\" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosFor the five-time Paralympic medalist, swimming was the outlet that helped her make sense of her situation, but Weggemann hopes her message resonates even beyond sports.\"We all carry moments that bring trauma and grief and loss and adversity.

              " 'Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN)The press conference in Dubai ahead of the World Chess Championship is running 30 minutes late. However, that hasn\\'t quelled the feverish anticipation of the crowd of journalists clambering for a good spot to photograph Magnus Carlsen, the world\\'s best chess player. He will face off against challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi across 14 games for an eye-watering prize fund of $2.24 million. Friday\\'s opening match was drawn as game two on Saturday.Interest in chess spiked at the beginning of the pandemic, and again in October 2020 after the release of the Netflix series, \"The Queen\\'s Gambit.\" In the first three weeks after its debut, sales of chess sets went up by 87% in the US and sales of books about chess leaped 603%, according to marketing research company NPD Group.Not since the 1970s, when American legend Bobby Fischer burst onto the scene, has the game captured the attention of the world like this. Is chess sexy again? It doesn\\'t matter for Carlsen, as he prepares to defend his title.Magnus Carlsen in Dubai ahead of his World Chess Championship showdown. \"The question is whether smart is the new sexy? And in that case, chess most certainly is. Personally, I don\\'t really care,\" he told CNN\\'s Connect the World in an exclusive television interview ahead of his first game. Read MoreA soft laugh when saying this comes as a surprise, considering his dour attitude throughout the day. It didn\\'t take long for him to drop his smile and refocus on what he does best -- winning.\"The world championship is not a question of enjoyment so much. In events like this, it\\'s more business.\"Seizing the momentCarlsen tries hard to be indifferent toward anything at all during the press conference and interview. But he does have strong opinions on how the game should be changed to make sure it holds the attention of the current groundswell of interested players. \"I\\'ve been somebody who\\'s supported having quicker games in the world championship for a long time,\" he said. \"I think for people who are not into chess at all, who don\\'t know anything about the game, you\\'re more naturally attracted to quicker games.\"World championship games can last hours and often end in ties because mistakes are so rare. Carlsen\\'s last two championship matches ended in ties and the players had to be separated by tiebreakers. It rankles the Norwegian grandmaster that he didn\\'t win outright and he aims to show what he is truly capable of against Nepomniachtchi.Ian Nepomniachtchi is the challenger for Magnus Carlsen\\'s crown in Dubai. \"I didn\\'t show nearly what I was capable of in the critical moments,\" he said. \"I feel it\\'s a lot about myself and I\\'m just really, really anxious to get going and to show more of what I\\'m capable of than I have been able to [so far].\"Carlsen\\'s love of fast-paced chess isn\\'t surprising, considering he is the current world champion in both \"Rapid\" and \"Blitz\" formats -- games that generally last for 15 minutes or less.His tiebreak wins in previous championship games were both in the rapid format and there are numerous videos on YouTube where his quick thinking is showcased. Computers are now powerful enough to calculate billions of possible move combinations in seconds, ably deciding the best possible option. It makes preparation more exacting and less enjoyable, and Carlsen thinks quicker games would help solve that.\"If people are attracted to the game, if they enjoy it, whatever motivation they have for that -- whether it\\'s because others love it or it comes from within -- I think it\\'s great regardless.\"The greatest ever?Carlsen could rightly be considered the greatest chess player ever. He has been the world champion for eight years and holds the longest unbeaten run in history. He only trails Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov in weeks spent as the highest rated player.  \"I would say that Garry dominated for 20 years. And even if I were to win this championship, I would still have a way to go to reach his heights,\" Carlsen said. \"And if I don\\'t, that will not lose me any sleep.\"Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in Lisbon on November 3.Now, a new challenger is being tipped to eclipse both their achievements. Alireza Firouzja beat one of Carlsen\\'s own records just this week. The 18-year-old Iranian-born French player became the youngest-ever to reach an Elo rating of 2,800, a feat only achieved by 14 other players in history.While Carlsen is confident he can beat Nepomniachtchi -- as do the majority of pundits -- he is not so sure about the new world no. 2, Firouzja.  \"His achievements are simply extraordinary, and it\\'s clear that he\\'s been all already dubbed the crown prince for a long time. He\\'s the one to watch both for me and for others. And hopefully, that will motivate all of us,\" he said. For now, Carlsen reigns supreme over the world of chess and will continue to do so for years to come if he can win in Dubai over this next fortnight.',\n",

              " ' (CNN)It was Premier League club Newcastle United\\'s first match of a new era. St. James\\' Park was packed to capacity with expectant fans and the sound of jubilant chants filled the air on the Tyneside on Sunday, October 17th.Following the club\\'s controversial takeover by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund [PIF], the mood of the Northern English city has been nothing but celebratory and the atmosphere at that particular match was close to delirious.The black-and-white colors of the club could be seen in every stand, on shirts and adorning flags, while a giant banner was held up to spell out some of the words from a famous song about the River Tyne that Newcastle proudly sits upon:\"This is a mighty town built upon a solid ground and everything they\\'ve tried so hard to kill -- we will rebuild,\" the flag read.The banner alludes to the supposed \\'killing\\' of Newcastle United, a perceived death many fans of the club have spent the past 14 years grieving over following the acquisition of the club by UK retail boss Mike Ashley -- who has long been accused of disinterest in Newcastle, of not bothering to invest in the club and of draining the soul out of the Magpies. Ashley\\'s counterpoint would be he wanted Newcastle to live within its means.Read MoreNewcastle United supporters celebrate outside St. James\\' Park on October 7, after the sale of the football club to a Saudi-led consortium was confirmed.Yet amidst the feverish celebrations that took place at St. James\\' Park that day, there was one discordant note: a van drove a \"Justice for Jamal Khashoggi\" poster around the stadium, a reference to the actual killing of a Saudi journalist and dissident that took place in 2018.The PIF -- which has an 80% stake in the club, as part of a three-party consortium -- is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the man who a US intelligence report named responsible for approving the operation that led to the murder of Khashoggi.Khashoggi entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on October 2nd, 2018, to pick up a document required in order to marry his fianc챕e -- but once he entered the building, he never left. US intelligence has since concluded that the Crown Prince himself approved the operation that ended in the killing of the journalist. In response to the conclusion drawn by US intelligence, the Saudi Foreign Ministry released a statement saying the country \"completely rejects the negative, false and unacceptable assessment in the report pertaining to the Kingdom\\'s leadership, and notes that the report contained inaccurate information and conclusions.\" It also added that Khashoggi\\'s killing was an \"abhorrent crime and a flagrant violation of the kingdom\\'s laws and values.\"Before the takeover, Amnesty International UK urged the Premier League to reconsider the decision and, since then, it has demanded that the League changes its owners\\' and directors\\' test to \"address human rights issues.\" LGBT+ fan groups alliance criticizes Newcastle takeoverAmnesty International chief executive Sacha Deshmukh said: \"Instead of allowing those implicated in serious human rights violations to walk into English football simply because they have deep pockets, we\\'ve urged the Premier League to change their owners\\' and directors\\' test to address human rights issues.\"And while the Premier League has said it has received \"legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United,\" there is no denying that the nation\\'s Crown Prince oversees the PIF.CNN reached out to the PIF for a statement for this story but its representatives declined to comment. In a press release issued when the takeover was first announced, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the PIF, said: \"We are extremely proud to become the new owners of Newcastle United, one of the most famous clubs in English football. We thank the Newcastle fans for their tremendously loyal support over the years and we are excited to work together with them.\" When the news was officially announced, Hatice Cengiz, the fianc챕e of the late Khashoggi, took to Twitter to call the takeover a \"shame and embarrassment\" for Newcastle United and said that she hoped the fans and players would \"hold their owners to account.\" CNN has reached out to the Premier League and PCP Capital Partners -- who make up part of the consortium that have taken over the club -- for comment but did not receive a response. In the press release issued with the announcement of the deal, Amanda Staveley, CEO of PCP Capital Partners, said: \"This is a long-term investment. We are excited about the future prospects for Newcastle United.Newcastle co-owner Amanda Staveley talks to the media as she leaves the foyer of St. James\\' Park.\"We intend to instill a united philosophy across the club, establish a clear purpose, and help provide leadership that will allow Newcastle United to go on to big achievements over the long term.\"Since the announcement of the takeover, the Premier League has agreed to meet with Amnesty for talks on revising the owners\\' and directors\\' test currently applied to any individual named as having a key role in controlling a club in the league.Short-lived joyWhile jubilation is still sweeping through most of the Newcastle fanbase right now, there are some supporters who intend to do exactly what Cengiz has called for -- holding their new owners accountable, as they struggle to come to terms with the fact that the future of their club is now partly in the hands of a regime which has been accused of serious human rights abuses.Emma Holbrook has followed the club since she was a child and has been witness to many of Newcastle\\'s lowest moments -- including Ashley\\'s trophyless tenure. She says that while she first felt excited at the prospect of a new direction for the club, that delight soon dissipated when she considered the fact Newcastle would now be tied with the Saudi regime. \"My initial response to the takeover was joy,\" she told CNN Sport. \"And then that quickly gave way to unease as I realized that we were now essentially owned by a powerful nation state -- one accused of sanctioning the murder of a journalist, as well as holding an appalling record on LGBTQ+ and women\\'s rights.\"READ: Newcastle United urges fans to not wear mock Arab head coverings\"And that also made me think about what a dire situation modern football -- not just Newcastle itself -- is in,\" she said. \"How have we reached the point where our only choice for owners lies between Mike Ashley, whose company Sports Direct has been accused of abusing workers\\' rights, and an all-powerful entity who are facing numerous allegations of sanctioning human rights abuses?\"When those accusations of abuses of workers\\' rights were made in 2016, Ashley told British lawmakers he was unaware of such practices but admitted his company had broken the law by failing to pay the national minimum wage to his employees.\"Everyone wants their club to succeed,\" added Holbrook. \"Everyone wants their club to win the biggest prizes in football. But no one wants to question the morality of how they got there.\"With the PIF acquisition and an injection of wealth into the club, Newcastle appears to be on the cusp of a golden age, but Holbrook wants fellow fans to be aware of the potential cost any future success could come with.\"It feels clear to me that Saudi Arabia has seen what Qatar -- another nation accused of committing human rights abuses -- has done with regards to buying PSG [Paris Saint-Germain], which has allowed that state to repackage its global image and to present a new version of itself to the rest of the world,\" said Holbrook, reflecting on the idea of sportswashing.JUST WATCHEDSportswashing: What is it and who practice it?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSportswashing: What is it and who practice it? 02:32\"And I don\\'t want Newcastle to become just a tool for a regime in need of a PR refresh.\"In response to accusations of workers\\' rights abuses in Qatar, the CEO of Qatar\\'s World Cup, Nasser Al Khater, told CNN that migrant worker reforms take time and can\\'t happen all at once.\"It\\'s a change of culture, it\\'s a change of behavior,\" he said. \"We\\'d be lying to ourselves, and fooling ourselves, if from one year to the next you can make those changes and think that everything\\'s going to be solved.\"On a personal level, Holbrook feels particular discomfort at the thought of her beloved club now being so closely involved with a homophobic regime. Does the footballing world really care about kicking homophobia out?In Saudi Arabia, homosexuality is illegal under the applied Sharia law, and punishments handed out for same-sex acts and intimacy include whippings, imprisonment and, in some cases, the death penalty.The nation is widely regarded as one of the world\\'s most unsafe places for LGBTQ+ people -- something which Holbrook finds impossible to ignore, given that there is now a direct link between Newcastle United and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the form of Mohammed bin Salman\\'s role in the PIF. \"It\\'s illegal for people like me to be themselves in Saudi Arabia,\" Holbrook told CNN. \"And the Crown Prince of that nation now essentially oversees the new owners of my club.\"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the chairman of the Saudi Public Investment Fund.To Holbrook, Newcastle\\'s support of its LGBTQ+ fans and of the Rainbow Laces campaign could start to ring hollow under its new ownership -- given the ongoing plight and persecution of LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia and the proximity of the club to the Crown.\"The club may be committed to making LGBTQ+ fans welcome in Newcastle -- but what about solidarity with LGBTQ+ Saudis? What will the club do to support them now that they have such close ties with the Crown that oppresses them?\"While Holbrook said she appreciates the fact that Newcastle fans themselves aren\\'t responsible for making such close connections with the Saudi regime, she believes that supporters still have a duty to hold their new owners accountable for human rights abuses.\"If we\\'re going to be so dedicated to the club on the pitch, then we need to use that same communal energy when it comes to off-pitch concerns too.\"Turning to grassroots footballAlthough the takeover of Newcastle by an ultra-wealthy consortium may feel like just another step towards a mini-Super League within the Premier League itself -- in which only the wealthiest clubs, including Manchester City, Chelsea and others are able to achieve success -- the continuing increase in riches in modern football is actually leading some fans to respond by pouring their time, money and energy into supporting local grassroots-level clubs.Gateshead FC is a club based in the Northern English town of Gateshead, which is joined to Newcastle by one of the bridges that runs over the Tyne. The club plays in the sixth tier of English football -- the National League North -- and it usually costs around 짙15 [$20] for a ticket to see them play. In contrast, a ticket to watch Newcastle often costs about 짙40 [$55] and the price of those tickets is expected to skyrocket should the club reach dizzying heights of success in the coming years thanks to its lucrative takeover. Rowan Lees is a Newcastle fan who\\'s found himself attending more Gateshead matches than those of his own club\\'s in recent times. As more and more money pours into the Premier League, Lees has decided he\\'d rather buy tickets to support a local club -- who\\'ve previously faced the threat of folding -- which provides weekly joy and escape for Gateshead residents and plays an essential role in the town\\'s community spirit.\"I love Newcastle, I love going to Newcastle matches -- but I feel like I\\'m supporting a local town and its people more whenever I go to see Gateshead play, especially now,\" Lees told CNN Sport. \"When I heard about the takeover, one of the first things I thought was about just how much it would affect ticket prices. I asked myself: \\'Could I be locked out of the club I support because I won\\'t be able to afford to go and see them play?\\'  \"I wondered if I might find myself only able to attend Carabao Cup (English League Cup) matches in the future -- because everything else will be out of my price range.\"World Cup 2022: Qatar is ready as it strongly contests accusations of workers\\' rights abuses Lees questions what it might mean for the city he lives in if fans end up priced out of attending their club\\'s matches every weekend.\"What happens when an institution of the city no longer serves the people of the city itself? When fans of the city\\'s historic club can\\'t afford to support the team in person?\"In an ironic way, I actually think that the takeover of Newcastle by extraordinarily wealthy backers will turn some fans towards grassroots football. \"There are many fans who would rather support a club that they know cares about them, too, than feel little affinity with just another eye-wateringly rich owner looking to use sportswashing to their advantage.\"Apart from feeling concerned over the threat of a disconnect between the club and the fans as a result of its newfound wealth, Lees -- like Holbrook -- is also worried about the ethics of Newcastle now being tethered to a state accused of restricting civil liberties.\"At first, of course, I was excited about the prospect of Newcastle becoming a major player in global football and a major player in the Premier League again,\" Lees said. \"Then came the questions over the ownership. It feels like we could become a plaything of the Saudi state -- and I don\\'t want that to happen.\"But, as modern football is now so often controlled and overseen by powerful owners, boards and other entities, Lees feels \"powerless as a fan.\" He said he hoped that fans could use the \"enormity of the club\" -- particularly as Newcastle is historically considered one of English football\\'s giants -- and its huge fanbase as \"some kind of leverage to hold Saudi Arabia to account.\" As was seen with the capitulation of the proposed European Super League in the spring, fans are still capable of harnessing their collective power to make a stand against even football\\'s biggest power brokers. JUST WATCHEDWhere did it all go wrong for the European Super League?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhere did it all go wrong for the European Super League? 03:16Lees thinks, if Newcastle fans could organize together to make it clear they do not condone Saudi Arabia\\'s concerning record of human rights abuses, then perhaps wider attention will be placed on the accusations and international pressure for the nation to face repercussions will intensify.But, of course, it may prove difficult to unite Newcastle\\'s fanbase in protest against their new owners and their association with the oppression of the Saudi people. While Lees, Holbrook and others may feel disillusioned with the takeover, there are many fans who are reluctant to criticize the new owners. At Newcastle\\'s match against Tottenham, the first of the club\\'s new era, some fans even waved Saudi flags and dressed in traditional Saudi garb. Newcastle United fans before the match against Tottenham Hotspur on October 17.\"As fans, there\\'s not a lot we can do about the human rights stuff,\" Paul Loraine, a supporter of the club, told the Guardian after the Saudi-led buyout of Newcastle was confirmed. \"We\\'re all wearing clothes borne out of sweatshops in countries with human rights issues. The moral compass is always a strange one in times like this.\"Will disillusionment with the Newcastle takeover inspire fan-owned club models?The acquisition of Newcastle by exceedingly wealthy owners is just the latest in a string of similar takeovers over the past 20 years. In 2003, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in what was then the biggest takeover in English football. In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group, owned by Sheikh Mansour of the United Arab Emirates. PSG were bought by Qatar Sports Investments, which subsequently made it one of the world\\'s wealthiest clubs. Ryan Monty is a Newcastle fan who thinks that the PIF takeover is just another indication of just how much modern football has become warped by extreme wealth.He has witnessed Newcastle\\'s decline in recent times as the club has suffered relegation and has languished near the bottom of the Premier League table whenever it has returned -- yet he is so disillusioned by what the takeover means for football as a whole that he says he would rather be stuck with the club\\'s current team and misfortunes, if it meant the Magpies weren\\'t owned by such a staggeringly rich investment group and the baggage it comes with.Newcastle United Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan arrives at the stadium prior to the Premier League match between Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.\"I\\'m worried that the purchase of Newcastle by Saudi Arabi\\'s PIF, the purchase of Man City by the UAE, and the fact that PSG are also essentially owned by a nation state are all part of the opening of Pandora\\'s box,\" Monty told CNN Sport. \"Now, where does it stop? It just feels like any teams that aren\\'t supported by these all-powerful countries will fail to achieve any success.\"Monty is worried about the increasingly uneven playing field of the Premier League, and while he wants to see Newcastle reach prestigious competitions like the Champions League again, he says he\\'d much rather see the club owned by fans than to see it sign the best players in the world.\"I\\'d like to see the Premier League introduce a similar model for club ownership to the one that exists in the German Bundesliga,\" Monty said. \"I would rather see Newcastle owned by the fans than see Messi, Neymar and Mbapp챕 as our front three. I mean that.\"Monty is referring to the system in the Bundesliga in which the famous \\'50+1\\' rule means that clubs must be majority-owned by their fans.By contrast, there is no such model in the Premier League -- Newcastle itself is now owned by the PIF, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports and Media. No fans are involved in the ownership of the club and there is no mandate within the top level of English football to ensure that fans have some say in who runs their club.And much like Lees and Holbrook, Monty isn\\'t just frustrated with the game of extreme wealth that top-tier English football has become -- he\\'s also finding it impossible to ignore the way the club is now tethered to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince.Saudi Arabia to host maiden F1 Grand Prix, but human rights abuses overshadow country\\'s global sporting ambitions \"I want Newcastle United to be something to be proud of again,\" he said. \"But not at the cost of sportswashing.\"The adoration pouring out for the takeover right now could so quickly turn to worship for Mohammed bin Salman himself -- and we all know what he stands accused of and what sort of oppression the Saudi Arabian people are facing.\"While Monty -- like many other Magpies -- was critical of Ashley and his time as Newcastle owner, he is fearful of the \"moral vacuum\" that comes with this takeover.\"It\\'s as if we\\'ve leapt out of the frying pan and straight into the fire.\"The club and its new owners can talk all they like about improving the women\\'s team, for example, with this new injection of money which can bring new training facilities and resources -- but there\\'s been no mention at all of how women are treated in Saudi Arabia. It\\'s being brushed under the carpet.\"Monty says that any promise from the club to continue to support LGBTQ+ rights will just feel like \"lip service\" -- and similarly to Holbrook -- he wonders what it means, if anything at all, for Newcastle\\'s players to wear rainbow-colored laces when there is now such a \"cozy relationship between the club and a regime that persecutes LGBTQ+ people.\"And while the takeover is seen by many as an attempt by Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi Arabia to recalibrate their global image, Monty thinks that the optics of the acquisition itself are having a rather undesired effect on Newcastle.The club is currently facing criticism from a variety of angles, including other Premier League clubs -- who have held emergency meetings to question how the takeover was allowed to happen so quickly -- and their fans, LGBTQ+ activist groups, aforementioned human rights organizations and across the media landscape.\"Nobody comes out of this situation looking good,\" Monty concluded. \"Especially not Newcastle.\"Remembrance of things pastIf there\\'s anyone that can identify with the conflict and bewilderment Newcastle fans are feeling right now, it\\'s Manchester City fans.They\\'ve already lived through the impact of a huge takeover by a staggeringly wealthy investment group -- which itself also has close ties to the sovereignty of a nation state with a questionable record on human rights.Kate Roper has watched as the Citizens have usurped the crown of the North from big brother Manchester United and -- as much as she has enjoyed the meteoric rise of the club that was once dismissed as the \"noisy neighbor\" of United by Sir Alex Ferguson -- she warns Newcastle fans of the pitfalls that come with success bankrolled by a royal with almost unlimited resources at hand.\"Despite all the trophies and beyond the heights we\\'ve scaled, I think there is a nostalgia for the past for many City fans,\" Roper told CNN Sport.\"Lots of fans remember what it was like before we were taken over by Sheikh Mansour, when we had to fight just to stay up and avoid relegation again, and I think they still cling to the days when no one knew what the result of the next match was going to be and when winning a derby over United was a shock outcome that would lead to delirium. We cherished those days.\"Roper says that, although she still relishes in City\\'s emergence as one of the most successful clubs in the world, she worries that a part of its soul has been lost to global idealization and commercialization -- something which she feels Newcastle fans should be wary of as they enter into this strange new era.\"One of the reasons that I love City so much is because it\\'s a very local club that takes great pride in coming from Maine Road,\" she said. \"But now that there is so much focus on its international image and what kind of global markets the club can break into, I do wonder if all the money that City has is going to the parts of Manchester that actually need it beyond football -- to the local community, to foodbanks and Moss Side, where the stadium at Maine Road used to lie.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosCity has previously told CNN that its investment has been as much about regenerating East Manchester as it has been about building an elite football team that regularly challenges for the sport\\'s major trophies.Roper went on to say that, as long as City continues to be injected with immeasurable wealth, she\\'s worried that its connection with the supporters that championed the club as an underdog for many years could begin to wither away as some fans begin to see through the shine of trophies.\"The sheer amount of money that the club has -- to the point that, at any time, we could sub on star players during a match, where many other clubs can\\'t afford to do that -- does often feel wrong,\" she said to CNN. Only time will tell if the PIF\\'s acquisition will actually lead Newcastle into a new world defined by success, trophies and global worship, but one thing is certain: there are some vocal fans that feel this takeover is just another example of modern football\\'s obsession with wealth and its disregard for anything else, including concerns over human rights, the feelings of LGBTQ+ fans and the duty a club has to its community.For Newcastle United itself, this is the beginning of a strange and unpredictable journey that may lead to heights it couldn\\'t have dreamt of.For the fans that don\\'t want the Magpies to become a toy for the Saudi state to play with, it\\'s the beginning of a complicated relationship with the very club they hold so dear to their hearts.',\n",

The police said coming to collect the pigs wasn\\'t their jurisdiction and the RSPCA would come and help when they could but they \"were very overstretched.\" \"What happened was I was there for most of the day until dusk, and we\\'d managed to lead them to the far corner of the course,\" Marshall explains. \"So we got them to the corner of the course and left them there. We couldn\\'t approach them, we closed the course because they\\'re obviously dangerous. \"They ended up on the Tuesday night on the side road outside the golf club.

French Interior Minister G챕rald Darmanin said five women were among the dead, two people had been rescued, and one is still missing. An initial toll said 31 people had died but the minister revised this number down to 27 late Wednesday.Four suspected traffickers accused of being directly linked to the doomed crossing had been arrested, Darmanin said, according to Agence France-Presse.The International Organization for Migration\\'s missing migrants project said the tragedy was the largest loss of life in the Channel since they began collecting data in 2014.The narrow waterway between Britain and France is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Refugees and migrants fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in the world\\'s poorest or war torn countries risk the dangerous crossing, often in dinghies unfit for the voyage and at the mercy of people smugglers, hoping to claim asylum or economic opportunities in Britain. Read MoreDarmanin said the migrants\\' dinghy had deflated, and when rescuers had arrived it was \"deflated like an inflatable garden pool,\" according to Reuters\"Those primarily responsible for this despicable situation are the smugglers, that is to say criminals who, for a few thousand euros, organize human trafficking from Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, Asia and who then use these people to bring them to Belgium, the Netherlands, France, especially to cross the Channel and to go to Great Britain,\" Darmanin said. Fire trucks arrive at Calais harbour Wednesday after at least 31 migrants died in the sinking of their boat off the coast of Calais.Migrants once sought to smuggle themselves aboard the trucks that regularly crossed the Channel on ferries or by rail from France. But in recent years that route has become more expensive, with people-smugglers charging thousands of euros for each attempt. So far this year, more than 25,700 people have crossed the English Channel to the United Kingdom in small boats, according to data compiled by Britain\\'s PA Media news agency -- three times the total for the whole of 2020. On Wednesday alone, French authorities rescued 106 people adrift in various boats in the English Channel, and more than 200 people made the crossing.Accusations of politicizing the migrant crisisFrench President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson both expressed horror at the tragedy, with Macron saying his country would not let the English Channel become a graveyard. The two leaders agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent the migrant crossings but accused each other of not doing enough. \"To the families of the victims, to their loved ones, I want to express my compassion and the unconditional support of France,\" Macron said in a statement. \"I assure them that everything will be done to find and condemn those responsible, networks of smugglers who exploit misery and distress, endanger human lives and ultimately decimate families.\"In a phone call between the two leaders, Macron called on Johnson to stop politicizing the migrant crisis for domestic political gain, saying he \"expected the British to cooperate fully and refrain from politicizing a dramatic situation for political purposes,\" according to a readout of their call from the Elysee Palace.He underlined the \"shared responsibility of France and the United Kingdom\" to deal with the migrant crisis on their sea border, the statement said.French Interior Minister Darmanin accused Britain of not delivering enough resources to help France combat the Channel crossings.\"The answer must also come from Great Britain,\" Darmanin said outside of a hospital in Calais on Wednesday night, adding the resources that United Kingdom is giving France \"remains minimal compared to the resources that we [France] are obviously putting in place to put in more police officers, more gendarmes, more cameras, more resources in general.\"Smuggling networksMacron said France had been working with the United Kingdom for several months to dismantle smuggling networks.\"Since the beginning of 2021, thanks to the mobilization of 600 police officers and gendarmes, 1,552 smugglers have been arrested on the northern coast and 44 smuggling networks have been dismantled,\" he said. \"Despite this action, 47,000 attempts to cross to Great Britain have been made since January 1, with 7,800 migrants saved by our rescue services.\"The country\\'s sea minister Annick Girardin said French, British and Belgian helicopters were searching for the missing.French Prime Minister Jean Castex described the incident as a \"tragedy.\" \"My thoughts are with the many missing and injured, victims of criminal smugglers who exploit their distress and misery,\" he said in a tweet.A boat from a French volunteer sea rescue organisation, Societe Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer, arrives Wednesday at Calais harbour carrying the bodies of migrants.British Prime Minister Johnson said he was \"shocked and appalled, and deeply saddened by the loss of life at sea.\" \"My thoughts and sympathies are, first of all with the victims and their families, and it\\'s an appalling thing that they have suffered,\" Johnson told reporters.\"But I also want to say that this disaster underscores how dangerous it is to cross the Channel in this way. And it also shows how vital it is that we now step up our efforts to break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way, and that\\'s why it\\'s so important that we accelerate if we possibly can all the measures contained in our borders ... so that we distinguish between people who come here legally, and people who come here illegally.\"He added that the authorities would \"leave no stone unturned to the business proposition of the human traffickers and the gangsters ... who are literally getting away with murder.\"Johnson said it was time for Britain, France and Europe to \"step up\" and work together.

The leaders agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent the migrant crossings -- which have increased dramatically this year -- but also accused each other of not doing enough.Read MoreIn a phone call on Wednesday night, Macron went further and urged Johnson to stop politicizing the migrant crisis for domestic political gain, according to a French readout of their conversation.Johnson on Thursday said he had written to Macron to set out five steps he believes should be taken as soon as possible to avoid further deaths of people trying to cross the English Channel in small boats.Police seal off the area around the rescue operation at France\\'s Calais harbor on November 24.In a thread on Twitter, Johnson stated that both parties had acknowledged the \"urgency of the situation.\" His proposal includes more joint patrols to prevent boats leaving French beaches, better intelligence sharing and immediate work on a bilateral returns agreement.\"An agreement with France to take back migrants who cross the Channel through this dangerous route would have an immediate and significant impact,\" Johnson said.\"If those who reach this country were swiftly returned the incentive for people to put their lives in the hands of traffickers would be significantly reduced,\" Johnson added. \"This would be the single biggest step we could take together to reduce the draw to Northern France and break the business model of criminal gangs.\"Fight against smugglersEarlier Thursday, the Member of Parliament for Dover, England, where many migrants arrive from France, told CNN that the deaths in the Channel were \"entirely foreseeable,\" and cast the problem as a border policing issue whose solution lay in France.\"This was an entirely foreseeable tragedy that sooner or later one of these boats would capsize and people would die,\" Natalie Elphicke told CNN near Dover\\'s harbor Thursday.\"People are safe in France, and the best way to keep people safe is to keep them on shore, not in the hands of people smugglers in the middle of the Channel,\" she added.The British politician added that the French \"are standing by where people are getting into boats and they\\'re not stopping them. That\\'s where the policy needs to change, on the French side.\"French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin speaks to the press in front of a hospital in Calais, northern France, after at least 27 people died off the city\\'s coast.Meanwhile French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin urged more support from European neighbors, telling radio station RTL on Thursday that France cannot be the \"only ones who can fight against smugglers.\"\"We are saying this to our Belgian friends ... We are saying this to our German friends... And we are saying this to our English friends, that they must help us to fight against the smugglers who are international, who play with the borders,\" Darmanin said.Asked why the UK attracts so many illegal migrants, Darmanin pointed to Britain\\'s methods of managing migration and its thriving labor market. \"There\\'s obviously mismanagement of immigration in Britain,\" he said. In the coming days, Darmanin will be holding meetings on better preventing \"arrivals on French soil\" coming from southern, northern and eastern migration routes, President Macron told reporters Thursday. By the time these migrants reach the English Channel it \"is already too late\" he said of the deadly crossing.French President Emmanuel Macron speaks during a press conference following a meeting with his Croatian counterpart in Zagreb on Thursday.Macron said France would continue to use drones and reservists in response to the situation -- and seek extra mobilization from UK forces. Both France and the UK must work together dismantling the smugglers\\' networks, he said.The UK\\'s Immigration Minister Kevin Foster, meanwhile, told the BBC on Thursday that his government was also determined to \"smash\" the \"really evil business model\" of people-smuggling.That included looking to increase penalties for smuggling to life in prison, and improve \"safe\" immigration routes directly from zones of conflict or refugee camps, he said. Foster added that the UK has started paying France $72 million in installments to tackle the crisis.A deadly crossing Five people-smugglers have now been arrested in connection with Wednesday\\'s deadly sea crossing, Darmanin told RTL Thursday. He added that one of the smugglers arrested on Wednesday night had \"German license plates\" and \"bought these boats in Germany.\"Darmanin said that the two survivors from the tragedy are Somali and Iraqi nationals who suffered \"serious hypothermia\" and were transferred to hospital in Calais, northern France.The narrow waterway between Britain and France is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Refugees and migrants fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in the world\\'s poorest or war-torn countries risk the dangerous crossing, often in dinghies unfit for the voyage and at the mercy of people smugglers, hoping to claim asylum or economic opportunities in Britain.Dozens dead in Channel tragedy, after inflatable boat sinks off French coastDarmanin said the migrants\\' dinghy had collapsed, and when rescuers had arrived it was \"deflated like an inflatable garden pool,\" according to Reuters.Despite Wednesday\\'s tragedy, desperate people continue to make the perilous journey across the Channel. One group in life jackets and blankets were seen huddled together on board a lifeboat arriving at Dover on Thursday morning, the UK\\'s Press Association reported.Migrants once sought to smuggle themselves aboard the trucks that regularly crossed the Channel on ferries or by rail from France. But in recent years that route has become more expensive, with people-smugglers charging thousands of euros for each attempt.So far this year, more than 25,700 people have crossed the English Channel to Britain in small boats, according to data compiled by PA Media news agency -- three times the total for the whole of 2020. On Wednesday alone, French authorities rescued 106 people adrift in various boats in the Channel, and more than 200 people made the crossing.Earlier this month, French sports retailer Decathlon announced it would stop selling kayaks in some stores in northern France, in a bid to prevent people using them to make the dangerous sea crossing to England.An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Masrour Barzani.

              " 'Sign up for CNN\\'s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. (CNN)Scientists studying ancient disease have uncovered one of the earliest examples of spillover -- when a disease jumps from an animal to a human -- and it happened to a Neanderthal man who likely got sick butchering or cooking raw meat. Researchers were reexamining the fossilized bones of a Neanderthal who was found in a cave near the French village of La Chapelle-aux-Saints in 1908. The \"Old Man of La Chapelle,\" as he became known, was the first relatively complete Neanderthal skeleton to be unearthed and is one of the best studied. More than a century after his discovery, his bones are still yielding new information about the lives of Neanderthals, the heavily built Stone Age hominins that lived in Europe and parts of Asia before disappearing about 40,000 years ago. The man, thought to be in his late 50s or 60s when he died about 50,000 years ago, had advanced osteoarthritis in his spinal column and hip joint, a study from 2019 had confirmed. However, during that reanalysis, Dr. Martin Haeusler -- a specialist in internal medicine and head of the University of Zurich\\'s Evolutionary Morphology and Adaptation Group at the Institute of Evolutionary Medicine -- realized that not all the changes in the bones could be explained by the wear and tear of osteoarthritis. Read More\"Rather, we found that some of these pathological changes must be due to inflammatory processes,\" he said. \"A comparison of the entire pattern of the pathological changes found in the La Chapelle-aux-Saints skeleton with many different diseases led us then to the diagnosis of brucellosis.\"The study with those findings was published in the journal Scientific Reports last month. Zoonotic diseaseCave chamber closed for 40,000 years could hold the key to the lives of NeanderthalsBrucellosis is a disease that\\'s still widespread today. Humans generally acquire the disease through direct contact with infected animals, by eating or drinking contaminated animal products, or by inhaling airborne agents, according to the World Health Organization. Most cases are caused by unpasteurized milk or cheese from infected goats or sheep.It\\'s also one of the most common zoonotic diseases -- illnesses that are transmitted from animals to humans. They include viruses like HIV and the coronavirus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic. Brucella has a wide range of symptoms, including fever, muscular pain and night sweats, Haeusler said. It can last from a few weeks to many months or even years. Long-term problems resulting from the disease are variable but can include arthritis pain, back pain, inflammation of the testes -- which can lead to infertility -- and inflammation of the heart valves known as endocarditis, which Haeusler said was the most common cause of death from the disease. The paper said the case was \"the earliest secure evidence of this zoonotic disease in hominin evolution.\"The disease has also been found in Bronze Age Homo sapiens skeletons, which date back to around 5,000 years ago.DietBrucellosis is found in many wild animals today, and Haeusler said that the Neanderthal man likely caught the disease from butchering or cooking an animal that had been hunted as prey. Possible sources include wild sheep, goats, wild cattle, bison, reindeer, hares and marmots -- all of which were components of the Neanderthal diet. However, the paper said that the two large animals Neanderthals hunted, mammoths and woolly rhinoceros, were unlikely to be the disease reservoir -- at least based on the animals\\' living relatives, in which brucellosis has been largely undetected.Given the man lived to what must have been a very old age for the period, Haeusler suspected that the Neanderthal may have had a milder version of the disease. A tiny bone is changing how we think about NeanderthalsThe \"Old Man of Chapelle\" played a significant role in misconceptions about Neanderthals being primitive Stone Age brutes, according to the Smithsonian. More recent research suggests that they were just as smart as we are. An early reconstruction of the skeleton depicted the man with a slouching posture, bent knees and the head jutted forward. It was only later that scientists realized the skeleton had a deforming kind of osteoarthritis and perhaps was not a typical Neanderthal. Haeusler said the study he published in 2019 showed that, even with the wear and tear from degenerative osteoarthritis, the \"Old Man of Chapelle\" would have walked upright. The man also had lost most of his teeth and may have had to have been fed by other members of his group. ',\n",
              " ' (CNN)A two-time NBA scoring champion knows a winner when he sees it: Tracy McGrady is backing Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors to vindicate his preseason championship prediction.T-Mac -- a seven-time All-Star across a 16-year career -- was the league\\'s back-to-back highest scorer in 2003 and 2004 as part of the Orlando Magic before retiring in 2013, three years before Curry would win the first of his two scoring titles.Now into his 12th season in the Bay Area, Curry has continued his one-man assault of the record books with dogged consistency, twice being named the league\\'s most valuable player en route to three NBA championships.The 33-year-old point guard has already been serenaded with MVP shouts and dazzled again this season, following up a 50-point haul against the Atlanta Hawks with another starring role in the Warriors\\' 117-99 dominant victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday night.Curry sunk nine three-pointers in a 37-point performance to pass 2,900 career regular season three-pointers, putting him within range of all-time leader and Hall of Famer Ray Allen on 2,973.Read MoreTracy McGrady thinks Steph Curry is going to lead the Warriors to the title this season.READ: How CJ McCollum is using his love of wine to become a different type of trailblazerContent to now admire and love the game from the sidelines as an analyst, McGrady believes Curry will justify his NBA foresight.\"You\\'re not going to believe me, but before the season started, I had the Warriors,\" McGrady told CNN Sport\\'s Andy Scholes.\"I just look at who Steph is, I look at the pieces that they have on that team. Klay [Thompson] is not even back yet, the emergence of a guy like Jordan Poole, you brought [Andre] Iguodala back, Draymond [Green] looks fantastic. [James] Wiseman is not even on the court -- and these guys are off to a wonderful start.\"Steph, you seen the other night had 50 points. I mean, you just don\\'t know who to key in on. It\\'s going to be a hell of a run when Klay gets back and they could put that together.\"They\\'re going to be tough because the shooting is outstanding on his team. To have four or five guys that shoot the ball better than anybody in the league and the way they play team basketball, it\\'s tough to really game plan against a team like that.\"LeBron to the Lakers\\' rescue?Victory over the Nets improved the Warriors\\' record to an NBA-best 12-2 on the season, keeping them top of a Western Conference that many had initially tipped the Los Angeles Lakers to lead.The injury absence of one of the greatest players of all-time in LeBron James stands as a notable mitigating circumstance, but the Lakers have made an underwhelming start to the season.Tuesday night\\'s 121-103 defeat to the Chicago Bulls dropped the Lakers to 8-7 and leaves them middling in seventh place, though the reportedly imminent return of 17-time All-Star James from his abdominal strain may well inspire an upturn in fortunes.James has struggled with injury this season, but T-Mac thinks that the veteran superstar\\'s teams are always in it with a chance.But can James lift the oldest team in the league to the title?\"I think they can,\" T-Mac said. \"Any team that LeBron is part of, they can win a championship.\"I think they\\'re built for the playoffs. This is a marathon for them because these guys are up in age. It\\'s going to look spotty at times, it\\'s not going to look like they can win a championship.\"They\\'re still trying to put things together; we\\'re talking about adding a lot of new pieces to this team to build that chemistry.\"So I like their team. I just like Golden State better.\"Simmons Sixers sagaOver in the Eastern Conference, the Philadelphia 76ers sit on an identical record to the Lakers following a crushing 120-85 defeat to the Utah Jazz on Wednesday that made it five losses in a row.The Ben Simmons saga continues to loom large over the team -- the Australian point guard reportedly receiving another fine for not turning up to the Sixers\\' run of six away games -- in a public stand-off that has bubbled continuously since an incident involving a play late in the team\\'s Game 7 Eastern Conference Semifinals defeat to the Hawks last season.However, McGrady believes both parties must take responsibility for the seemingly inevitable divorce of the Sixers and a \"fantastic\" player.\"I think it\\'s blame on both sides, to be honest with you,\" McGrady said.\"How things really played out in the playoffs last year, with Ben not shooting the ball, how the fans reacted to his playoff performance. Philly is a tough, very, very tough fan base and you got to be mentally tough to be able to play in a city like Philly.\"I just think with how Ben played in those playoff series and how those fans reacted, I knew it was going to be tough for him to go back coming into this season to play for the Philadelphia 76ers, and I\\'m sure he felt that.\"I think it\\'s blame on both sides, to be honest with you,\" McGrady said of the Sixers-Ben Simmons rift.\"The Sixers knew that. They should have done something to protect this kid and not have this go on for so long. So I blame both sides really and, hopefully, they can rectify this situation so Philly can move on and Ben Simmons can move on with his career because I think the kid is fantastic as a basketball player.\"Hopefully, this offseason, he worked on his shooting ability to come in so whoever he plays for ... he can then become a complete player because I love his game.\"On Kyrie: \\'I have to respect his decision on not getting vaccinated\\'For all the coverage of the Simmons saga, it still may not be the current highest profile NBA player-team impasse -- a title that surely goes to Kyrie Irving and the Nets.In light of his decision not to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the Nets\\' seven-time All-Star guard remains away from the team. Irving had initially only been unable to play home games as per the New York vaccine mandate, though the Nets announced ahead of the season that Irving would not play or practice with the team until he is eligible to be a full participant.Irving\\'s absence leaves the burden of responsibility upon the shoulders of superstar duo Kevin Durant and James Harden, though McGrady believes he would have respected Irving\\'s choice if he had been his teammate.McGrady says of Irving: \"I want to win a championship and I would love for my teammate to be there, but I also have to respect his decision on not getting vaccinated.\"\"Obviously, the main goal is to win a championship, and we\\'re going to need everybody to be a part of that,\" McGrady said.\"With Kyrie choosing not to because of whatever reason he has, I have no other reason but to respect his decision. I want to win a championship and I would love for my teammate to be there, but I also have to respect his decision on not getting vaccinated.\"Speaking to CNN Sport on Veteran\\'s Day and having just returned from visiting American troops in Qatar, T-Mac reflected on the realization of a career that he attributes to the sacrifice of servicemen and women.\"My dream was to make it to the NBA ... and my dream came true,\" McGrady said.\"That game has taken me to so many places that I never thought I would be, to meet so many people all across the globe.\"Standing in front of our military -- if it wasn\\'t for them, my dream doesn\\'t come true. For what they sacrifice, their courage, what they do for us for our freedom. It was beautiful, a great day.\"',\n",

In a joint motion filed by the Office of the State Attorney and Evans on November 19, Evans said that she specifically fears for her life.  Evans asked the court to increase Stacy\\'s bond and place him on home confinement, a request Blechman ultimately denied.  Evans posted graphic video from the incident on her Instagram account and has publicly called on the NFL \"to confront the reality that players are experiencing PTSD from their time playing pro-football.\" Read MoreCNN has reached out to the NFL. Former NFL player Zac Stacy arrested after alleged attack on ex-girlfriendEvans says she intended to testify during Stacy\\'s initial court appearance on November 19 but was not able to after the hearing began earlier than scheduled, according to the joint motion filed the same day requesting she be allowed to testify and that the judge reconsider the bond amount.  During a first court appearance on November 19, a judge set bond at $10,150 and ordered Stacy to have no contact with the victim and to surrender his passport and firearms, according to CNN affiliate WESH. Stacy was charged with Aggravated Battery (Great Bodily Harm) and Criminal Mischief, according to court records. Stacy bonded out of Orange County Jail over the weekend, Blechman said Wednesday during the hearing.  Evans testified Wednesday that because Stacy was released from jail on bond over the weekend, she has been too afraid to return home.  \"My injuries from this incident are serious and likely permanent from what I\\'ve been told,\" she said without specifying. Luka said during Wednesday\\'s proceeding that the NFL player has changed his address to Alabama where he has taken up residence with his mother or brother. Luka told the court he did not believe Stacy, now residing two states away from Evans, posed a threat to her any longer.  Stacy told the judge there are no firearms inside this home. The judge advised a condition of his bond is that he may not be in the presence of a firearm. It was disclosed Stacy intends to enter a 30-day inpatient treatment facility program and then return home to live with his mother or brother. Stacy\\'s attorney, Thomas Luka, told CNN Wednesday the inpatient treatment program he will enter on December 1 is for mental health.\"He has had ongoing mental health issues for a number of years. This is in an inpatient intensive treatment program for mental health issues,\" Luka said over the phone.The judge reminded Stacy an important condition of his bond is that he have \"absolutely no contact\" with the victim, including through family members.  Although Blechman denied Evan\\'s request to increase Stacy\\'s bond and would not order home confinement, he did add a condition to the former NFL player\\'s bond that he could no longer enter the state of Florida unless traveling for a court appearance. Blechman cited Stacy\\'s willingness to appear in court Wednesday morning as the reason for denying Evan\\'s request.  Luka said he and his client are awaiting word on what charges the State\\'s Attorney\\'s Office would bring against Stacy. No date for arraignment has been set yet.',\n",

Non-governmental organizations have alleged that migrant workers involved in World Cup infrastructure projects have been mistreated and abused.  Qatar\\'s Ministry of Labour said in a statement that \"figures reported in media on migrant worker fatalities have been wildly misleading.\"  \"The government has been transparent about the health of our foreign population, and in reality, levels of mortality in Qatar are on par with wider demographics globally. Still, improving the health and well-being of foreign workers remains a top priority,\" the Ministry added.  FIFA President Gianni Infantino told CNN that, while there is still work to be done, he has seen \"great evolution\" in the Gulf country. \"I\\'ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized -- I mean not by FIFA -- but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,\" Infantino told CNN Sport\\'s Amanda Davies.

I think we can say that without the World Cup and ... the spotlight coming from the World Cup, the whole process would have been taking much more time.  \"Steps have been made, steps will be made. I think we need also to recognize the positives if we want to encourage those who have embraced a way like Qatar is to continue in that way, recognize what has been done, look at the concrete facts and figures make the necessary criticisms as well, but always try to be constructive and to see what has been done and what can be done more in a positive sense.\"  Set to be the first ever World Cup staged in the winter, the 2022 edition is set to kick-off in Qatar on November 21 and conclude on December 18.

The LA Lakers star was back on court for the first time following his second-ever career ejection against the Detroit Pistons on Sunday, and the 36-year-old exorcised any leftover frustrations in a 124-116 overtime victory over the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis.Despite the absence of Anthony Davis through illness, James stepped up with a season-high 39 points -- seven of which came in overtime -- as well as six assists and five rebounds to drag his team over the line.Point guard Malcolm Brogdon led scoring for the Pacers with 28 points, seven rebounds and two assists, as Indiana falls to 8-12 in the East.The Lakers trailed for the majority of the game, only nudging ahead for the first time late in the fourth quarter before two three-pointers in the closing 30 seconds from Pacers pair Justin Holiday and Chris Duarte sent the game into overtime.

LeBron James shoots during the second half against the Indiana Pacers.Ejection dramaThere was another ejection at a Lakers game, but this time it wasn\\'t a player. On Sunday, James was ejected after he made contact with Pistons star Isaiah Stewart in the face -- an altercation that sparked a confrontational reaction from Stewart and an on-court scuffle. Stewart was subsequently hit with a two-game suspension by the NBA for \"escalating\" the situation and \"repeatedly and aggressively\" pursuing James, who himself received a one-game ban for \"recklessly hitting\" the Pistons center in the face.Midway through overtime against the Pacers, James spoke to the referee and appeared to gesture at two fans sitting courtside. The pair were subsequently escorted out by security from Gainbridge Fieldhouse.James pointed out a pair of fans to security, who were then escourted out of the arena.\"There\\'s a difference between cheering on your home faithful, booing opponents, not wanting your opponents to be successful and there\\'s then moments where it goes outside the line with obscene gestures and words,\" James told reporters when asked about the incident after the game.\"That shouldn\\'t be tolerated in our game from nobody. I would never say it to a fan and a fan should never say it to a player.\"James also shed more light on his own ejection on Sunday, revealing he had not spoken to Stewart since the incident that he says was strictly \"accidental.\" \"I went over the apologize to him and you guys saw what happened after that,\" said James.\"Definitely accidental, I\\'m not that type of player. I hate to see what escalated after that. I thought it warranted an ejection because of what happened after that ... but a suspension, I didn\\'t think was warranted.\"James is defended by the Pacers\\' Brogdon.\\'A performance for the ages\\'Away from the ejection drama, Lakers coach Frank Vogel was simply happy to have his superstar back and to bear witness to \"a performance for the ages.\"\"I know he wanted to get this \\'W,\\'\" Vogel said. \"He really wanted to play in that Knicks game, he looks forward to that every year.

Creasy shared an email sent to her by the private secretary to the chairman of ways and means, which references rules published in September: \"You should not take your seat in the Chamber when accompanied by your child,\" and added that this also applied to Westminster Hall, the oldest building on the Parliamentary estate, used for state occasions and important ceremonies.

The Green Party has also decided to leave the minority coalition government with Andersson\\'s Social Democrats, it said. \"The current government will remain as an interim government until a new government is in place,\" it added.Andersson, 54, said she had told the speaker of Parliament she hoped to be reappointed as prime minister at the head of a \"single-party, Social Democrat government,\" Reuters reported.Read MoreShe replaced Stefan L철fven, who recently stepped down as both the country\\'s premier and as leader of the Social Democrats party.All the other Nordic countries -- Finland, Denmark, Norway and Iceland -- have previously elected female national leaders.

              " 'London (CNN)A UK government compensation scheme for migrants, many of whom came from the Caribbean to rebuild Britain after World War II, has paid out on just 5% of potential claims, British lawmakers say.The Windrush generation were invited to move to Britain in the 1940s and 1950s, but have subsequently faced hostile immigration crackdowns. In recent years, the British government has been heavily criticized for its treatment of migrants who traveled across the Atlantic on the Empire Windrush passenger liner, and their descendants. Some of the individuals, who have a legal right to live in the UK, have struggled to prove their immigration status and have been refused medical care, denied housing and deported or threatened with deportation.A damning new report from the House of Commons\\' influential Home Affairs Select Committee published Wednesday said the scheme, created in 2019, had \"become a source of further trauma rather than redress, and others have been put off from applying for the scheme altogether.\" As of the end of September, only 20.1% of the estimated 15,000 people expected to be eligible for compensation had applied, and only 5.8% of claimants had received a payment, the cross-party committee found. MPs also found that 23 people eligible individuals had died before receiving compensation. Read MoreThe committee report said the scheme was plagued by a \"litany of flaws\" with an \"excessive burden\" on applicants to provide evidence of losses suffered, protracted applications and payment processing, insufficient staffing of the scheme and a failure to provide exceptional payments to individuals in urgent need. UK promises to put right \\'unspeakable injustices\\' of Windrush immigration scandalThe report found that rather than rectify past mistreatment, the scheme had \"compounded the injustices\" people had faced. It acknowledged reforms introduced last December to expedite payments, but said the changes had not gone far enough. The committee recommended further action, suggesting the scheme -- currently under Home Secretary Priti Patel -- be transferred to an independent organization to rebuild trust and bolster applications.  \"The treatment of the Windrush generation by successive governments was truly shameful,\" MPs said in the report. \"No amount of compensation could ever repay the fear, humiliation, hurt and hardship that was caused to individuals who were affected.\"The committee added: \"That the design and operation of this scheme contained the same bureaucratic insensitivities that led to the Windrush scandal in the first place is a damning indictment of the Home Office, and suggests that the culture change it promised in the wake of the scandal has not yet occurred.\"Committee chair Yvette Cooper, a member of the opposition Labour Party, said: \"It has been four years since the Windrush scandal emerged and it is truly shocking how few people have received any compensation for the hardship they endured at the hands of the Home Office.\"Urgent action is needed to get compensation to those who have been so badly wronged,\" she added.UK government apology to 18 Windrush victims criticized as \\'drop in the ocean\\'Cooper continued that she found it \"staggering, given the failures of the Windrush Scandal, that the Home Office has allowed some of the same problems to affect the Windrush Compensation Scheme too.\"Alba Kapoor, senior policy officer at The Runnymede Trust, reacted to the report\\'s publication in a Twitter post from the race equality think tank, asking: \"How many more deaths will there be before the horrors of the Windrush scandal are addressed in a competent, compassionate and supportive manner?\"The organization said in a subsequent post that it backed the committee\\'s recommendation to turn over responsibility for the scheme to an independent body. \"The figures speak for themselves in highlighting the incompetence of the Home Office in addressing its own catastrophic failures,\" it added.Following the report\\'s publication, a Home Office spokesperson said in a statement to CNN: \"The Home Secretary and the department remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure that members of the Windrush generation receive every penny of compensation that they are entitled to. \"The Home Secretary overhauled the scheme in December to ensure more money is paid more quickly -- since then the amount of compensation paid has risen from less than 짙3 million to over 짙31.6 million, with a further 짙5.6 million having been offered. There is no cap on the amount of compensation we will pay out. \"We are pleased this report welcomes the changes made to the scheme in December and we continue to make improvements, such as simplifying the application process, hiring more caseworkers and removing the end date. We firmly believe that moving the operation of the scheme out of the Home Office would risk significantly delaying vital payments to those affected.\"',\n",

Ipsos MORI publishes its poll monthly, and November\\'s was carried out over a week during the COP26 climate conference. The event was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and received extensive national media coverage. Around 40% of people surveyed said climate change, pollution and the environment were among their top three concerns. The pandemic came second at 27% and Brexit was third, with 22%. Ipsos MORI interviewed more than 1,000 adults, who answered spontaneously and were not prompted with options as answers. Climate concern was 16 percentage points higher in November than October, when people expressed greater concern about Brexit, the pandemic and the economy. Read MoreWas COP26 successful? Here\\'s how climate summits make a differenceWhile there was a clear bump in interest during the COP26 conference, there has been longterm growth in concern about climate over the past decade, which has been confirmed by other polls, including from YouGov. The Ipsos MORI poll showed was a fairly even distribution of climate concern across age groups, genders and political affiliation.\"[It\\'s] very encouraging that climate change is no longer a preoccupation reserved to the young and the liberal,\" Gabriela Jiga-Boy, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Swansea, told CNN. \"It means that British society may not be very divided regarding climate change. This is very important in these times, when we discuss a lot about real or false polarization on issues, and we often exaggerate how polarized people actually are.\"Climate a top concern for older people, tooMen and women considered the climate crisis a top issue almost equally, at 40% and 41%, respectively, the poll showed. And supporters of the center-right Conservative Party and center-left Labour Party were equal in their concern for climate issues.In the age group of 55 and over, 47% of people said it was a top issue. For the 35 to 54 age group, it was 43%. Among those 18 to 34 years old, just 27% said the same, though that age group was less likely to say they were worried about any particular issue.While countries wrangle over who should pay for the climate crisis, a community on Lagos Island is being swallowed by the sea Ralitsa Hiteva, a senior research fellow in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex Business School, said that climate change is now a top priority among a majority of groups because the topic is \"becoming personal.\" That\\'s also true for how policies like net-zero emissions targets may affect them.Dozens of countries have set a net-zero emissions goal for mid-century, for which they plan to drastically reduce greenhouse emissions and \"capture\" excess, through actions like planing trees or using technology to remove carbon from fossil fuels. Such technology isn\\'t fully developed and remains controversial.  \"We are seeing that people are personally affected by things related to both the target for net zero, and are seeing and experiencing the impact of climate change -- from large wildfires to the rapid increases of the price of energy,\" Hiteva told CNN in an email.While concern about the climate crisis is fairly even among age groups, support for different types of climate action is more divisive.\"Older people are more inclined to pay for investment in infrastructure to improve the experience of future generations,\" she said, adding that younger adults were less likely to do so.\"The only way for this to translate into action is to use the momentum of the moment and engage people with re-imagining how infrastructure investment can be designed and used in an innovative way which is not only kinder to the environment but is also more inclusive and fairer.\"',\n",

              " ' (CNN)Three German political parties have sealed a deal for a new government, with left-leaning Olaf Scholz the proposed next chancellor following lengthy coalition negotiations and a historic election that sees Angela Merkel stepping down after 16 years at the helm. The incoming government\\'s vision for Germany includes plans to legalize cannabis. It also aims to phase-out coal by 2030 and have at least 15 million electric cars on the road by the same year. Mandatory Covid-19 vaccines would also be considered, amid soaring cases in the country. Under the agreement announced in Berlin on Wednesday, Scholz, of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), will head a three-party coalition with partners the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats. It follows a close September election and two months of negotiations to form a new government.Scholz, joined by coalition partner leaders, told a news conference that the \"traffic light government\" is here, referring to the red, yellow and green colors of the respective parties. \"We want to be daring when it comes to climate and industry,\" he said. The deal -- which sets out the government\\'s vision for its four-year term -- will now go to the wider party members for consideration. Barring any last-minute upsets, Scholz will be sworn in as chancellor early next month.Read MoreThe new government\\'s coalition parties are not traditional bedfellows. The pro-business Free Democrats is more usually aligned with the center-right, rather than the left-leaning SPD and Greens. Acting Chancellor Angela Merkel receives a bouquet of flowers from acting Finance Minister Olaf Scholz during a cabinet meeting Wednesday.  But on Wednesday Germany\\'s three-party coalition government presented a smiling, united front to gathered reporters. The prospective government spells the end of the Merkel era, and consigns her center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) into opposition after 16 years in power.Incoming Chancellor Scholz will take over the helm of Europe\\'s largest economy at a time of increasing diplomatic uncertainty in the European Union -- namely aggression from Russia and Belarus, and threats to the rule of law from Poland and Hungary.As Germany emerges from its worst climate disaster of recent years -- devastating floods over the summer that killed 180 people -- the Greens will also play an important role in steering the country towards a coal-free future.The new government plans to phase-out of coal by 2030 -- eight years earlier than Merkel\\'s party\\'s previous 2038 target. \"Step by step, we are ending the fossil fuel era,\" the coalition agreement said, adding that it was ensuring measures to \"bring Germany onto the 1.5-degree path\" of global warming. It also plans to introduce the controlled sale of cannabis \"to adults for recreational purposes.\" Only licensed stores would sell the cannabis, \"ensuring the protection of minors.\" The coalition will review the measure in four years. Mandatory vaccinations to be consideredBut chief among the hefty to-do list facing the incoming government is the acute Covid-19 wave gripping the country. Germany is battling surging cases that have pushed Europe back to the epicenter of the pandemic, prompting tough restrictions from neighboring countries and protests from lockdown-weary citizens across the bloc. On Wednesday, Scholz told reporters that mandatory vaccinations will be considered by the new coalition because \"vaccination is the way out of this pandemic.\"Case numbers are particularly dire in Germany\\'s eastern states where health officials have warned overstretched hospitals could soon run out of beds for intensive care patients.While Germany has vaccinated around 80% of its adult population, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), it still trails behind southern European countries such as Spain and Portugal.On Monday, Health Minister Jens Spahn didn\\'t mince his words as he urged more people to get their shots. Spahn told a press conference in Berlin he was certain that by the end of this winter, everyone in Germany would be \"vaccinated, recovered or dead,\" in relation to the Delta variant.Diplomatic shiftsMeanwhile the migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border, which Western leaders have accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating with the support of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has intensified tensions with the European Union\\'s volatile neighbor.The West\\'s leaders agree that democracy is under attack. How they can defend it is less obviousThe crisis too has turned a sharper focus on Russia\\'s influence in Europe -- not least the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will bring gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. German authorities last week paused the approval process for the pipeline amid issues with the company\\'s operating license.  Elsewhere populist governments in Poland and Hungary continue to push the boundaries of EU membership by rolling back core democratic values. Recently, the EU\\'s top court ruled Poland had violated the bloc\\'s laws relating to judicial independence.Scholz\\'s predecessor Merkel made a name as the steady hand of EU diplomacy, variously steering the bloc through the European debt and migrant crisis. Whether the new chancellor will also step up to the role of EU leader -- or leave those shoes for another to fill -- remains to be seen.Stephanie Halasz, Inke Kappeler and Chris Stern contributed to this report ',\n",

She re-appeared over the weekend in Beijing.The WTA, the main organizational body for women\\'s tennis internationally, has called for a transparent investigation and assurances about Peng\\'s safety and well-being, and has threatened to pull out of tournaments in China over the matter.\"If you had told me a week-and-a-half ago that the Women\\'s Tennis Association was going to be the most effective and bravest human rights organization in the world I would have thought you were bananas but here we are,\" Currie told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\"The WTA is essentially putting more than a billion dollars on the line over the life of a single member of the Women\\'s Tennis Association.\"Peng Shuai of China returns a shot against Daria Kasatkina of Russia during the women\\'s singles first round match of the 2019 China Open at the China National Tennis Center on September 28, 2019 in Beijing, China.Read MoreIn 25 years of working in human rights, she had never seen any group \"actually put something on the line like this for human rights,\" said Currie, the former U.S. Representative at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, nominated by then-President Donald Trump.On Sunday, Peng held a video call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, but the WTA has said this did not address or alleviate its concerns about her wellbeing.The United States, France, Britain and prominent tennis players have all expressed concerns over Peng, a former Olympian.It comes as Beijing is preparing to host the Winter Olympics next February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Games over China\\'s human rights record.\"The tennis season goes all year,\" said Currie. \"As long as players continue to express concern for her and this continues to be an issue with the WTA and they continue to raise her case, it will continue to remain in some kind of spotlight.\"It will be an issue at the Olympics and before that the Australian Open, and then Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

              " ' (CNN)Olaf Scholz has some big shoes to fill. The German Finance Minister will be sworn in as German chancellor next month, barring any 11th-hour setbacks -- weeks after he led his Social Democratic Party (SPD) to a narrow victory in September\\'s parliamentary elections. Under the agreement announced in Berlin on Wednesday, Scholz\\'s center-left party will head a three-party coalition with partners the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats. It follows two months of negotiations to form a new government.His ascension to the helm of that government will finally end the 16-year Angela Merkel era. Merkel did not contest the September vote, after announcing her decision to step down.Sleeping Beauty\\'s forest is dying. It\\'s not the only climate crisis facing Germany\\'s next chancellorScholz has positioned himself as a pragmatist and a safe pair of hands. In fact his political style is not dissimilar to that of Merkel -- the two are alike in many ways, despite hailing from rival parties. Read More\"He comes across as calm, measured, steady,\" said Corinna Hoerst, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Brussels. Scholz on Friday told reporters his \"traffic light government\" is here, referring to the red, yellow and green colors of the respective parties. \"We want to be daring when it comes to climate and industry,\" he said.The deal -- which sets out the government\\'s vision for its four-year term -- will now go to the wider party members for consideration, where it is expected to be approved.Hoerst said that as a moderate, Scholz is an outlier within his party. \"The SPD leadership are mostly leftist leaning and initially didn\\'t support him. So we don\\'t know yet who he will gather around him and who will influence his leadership style,\" she added.Hoerst\\'s colleague and the deputy director of GMF\\'s Berlin office, Sudha David-Wilp, said this centrism is another trait Scholz shares with Merkel. \"She always governed from the center and I think he will also try to do that if he does become chancellor, but it will also depend of course on what coalition parties demand,\" she said.Olaf Scholz, the SPD\\'s candidate for chancellor, on stage a day after the Bundestag elections.The 63-year-old -- a life-long member of the SPD -- was born in what was then West Germany, a detail that sets him apart from Merkel, who grew up in East Germany.Scholz served as the Labor and Social Affairs minister in Merkel\\'s first coalition government in the late 2000s. In 2011 he was elected mayor of Hamburg, a position he held -- with high levels of support -- until 2018.Since then, he has served as the vice-chancellor and finance minister in Merkel\\'s grand coalition government, a powerful position in German national politics. His profile rose even further when he oversaw Germany\\'s generous coronavirus compensation programs for businesses, employees and those who lost income because they had to quarantine during the pandemic.\"He has been [Merkel\\'s] right hand man when it comes to leading the country over the past four years ... he [played] second fiddle to Merkel, but he has tremendous power within the German government, and also in Europe [where he] represents Germany when it comes to Euro policies,\" David-Wilp said.Germany\\'s election will decide what life after Merkel looks like. Here\\'s what you need to knowUnlike Merkel, who has become a household name across the world during her long tenure, Scholz is not well known abroad -- beyond Brussels\\' political circles. Speaking in September he said forming a stronger and more sovereign European Union, as well as working on the good relationship between Germany and the United States, would be his key foreign policy goals if he does become chancellor. He added that as the world \"becomes more dangerous,\" democratic countries must cooperate. \"It is important that we work together, even if we do have conflict in one or the other question,\" he said. Scholz has had his share of political problems in the past. As mayor of Hamburg, he was criticized for his mishandling of violent protests that unfolded during a G20 meeting his city hosted in 2017.Hamburg descended into chaos during the summit, and hundreds of police officers were injured in clashes with protesters. Scholz had underplayed the potential risk from demonstrations, and so was blamed for the city\\'s lack of preparation. The jury is still out on what kind of chancellor Scholz might be, but few expect a radical change at the top of German politics. \"It will be a shift because there is no longer Merkel,\" Hoerst said, before adding: \"I doubt it will be big.\" CNN\\'s Rob Picheta, Frederik Pleitgen, Sugam Pokharel, Jennifer Deaton and Helen Regan contributed reporting.

              " 'Sign up for CNN\\'s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. (CNN)Octopuses, crabs and lobsters are capable of experiencing pain or suffering, according to a review commissioned by the UK government, which has added the creatures to a list of sentient beings to be given protection under new animal welfare laws.The report by experts at the London School of Economics looked at 300 scientific studies to evaluate evidence of sentience, and they concluded that cephalopods (such as octopuses, squid and cuttlefish) and decapods (such as crabs, lobsters and crayfish) should be treated as sentient beings. Vertebrates, animals with a backbone, are already classified as sentient in new animal welfare legislation currently under debate in the United Kingdom. A common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) moves along the seabe on August 2, 2017, in Marseille, France. \"The Animal Welfare Sentience Bill provides a crucial assurance that animal wellbeing is rightly considered when developing new laws. The science is now clear that decapods and cephalopods can feel pain and therefore it is only right they are covered by this vital piece of legislation,\" said Animal Welfare Minister Lord Zac Goldsmith in a statement.The Bill, which isn\\'t yet law, will establish an Animal Sentience Committee, which will issue reports on how well government decisions have taken into account the welfare of sentient animals. It is part of a wider government Action Plan for Animal Welfare.Read MoreThe report said lobsters and crabs shouldn\\'t be boiled alive and included best practices for the transport, stunning and slaughter of decapods and cephalopods.Learning more about cephalopods and decapodsThe report used eight different ways to measure sentience including learning ability, possession of pain receptors, connections between pain receptors and certain brain regions, response to anesthetics or analgesics, and behaviors including balancing threat against opportunity for reward and protection against injury or threat. It found \"very strong\" evidence of sentience in octopods and \"strong\" evidence in most crabs. For other animals in these two groups, such as squid, cuttlefish and lobsters they found the evidence was substantial but not strong. However, the report said these varying degrees of evidence reflected disparities in the amount of attention different animals have received from scientists. Red crabs, or ghost crabs, on Isla de la Plata, a small island off the coast of Manab챠, Ecuador. \"Scientific attention has gravitated towards some (animals) rather than others for reasons of practical convenience (e.g. which animals can be kept well in labs) and geography (e.g. which species are available where a lab is located). Because of this situation, we think it would be inappropriate to limit protection to specific orders of cephalopod, or to specific infraorders of decapod,\" the report said. The recent Netflix documentary \"My Octopus Teacher\" showcased the unique abilities of octopuses. The brain structure of octopuses is very different from that of humans, but it has some of the same functions as mammal brains, such as learning abilities, including being able to solve problems, and possibly the ability to dream.

On each gurney lay a body inside a black plastic bag.  The morgue has a capacity for 15 bodies, but on the day CNN visited, it had received 41. The excess bodies filled the corridor outside, while wails echoed from within the morgue. A woman had been allowed inside for a final glimpse of her father.  Bucharest University Hospital is the Romanian capital\\'s largest medical facility treating Covid-19 patients and is struggling through the country\\'s fourth wave, its worst yet.     \"I never thought, when I started this job, that I would live through something like this,\" said Ionita. \"I never thought such a catastrophe could happen, that we\\'d end up sending whole families to their graves.\" Europe is learning a crucial lesson -- vaccines work, but they alone won\\'t stop Covid nowSeveral floors above, all the beds but one in the hospital\\'s now-expanded intensive care units were full. A nurse was changing the sheets on the one vacant bed -- empty, because the person who occupied it now lay in the morgue. Read MoreRomania has one of Europe\\'s lowest vaccination rates. Just under 36% of the population has been vaccinated, even though the country\\'s vaccination campaign got off to a good start last December.  Medical workers and officials attribute this low vaccination rate to a variety of factors, including suspicion of the authorities, deeply held religious beliefs, and a flood of misinformation surging through social media.  Dr. Alexandra Munteanu, pictured at the Palatul Copiilor vaccination center in Bucharest on November 16, is ready to vaccinate as many people as needed -- if only they would come.When Dr. Alexandra Munteanu, 32, arrived for duty at one of Bucharest\\'s vaccination centers after an overnight shift in hospital, she found turnout was low. She\\'s perplexed that the gravity of the disease just doesn\\'t seem to have sunk in. \"There are lots of doctors, myself included, who work with Covid patients, and we are trying to tell people this disease actually exists,\" she said.   One of the country\\'s most vocal and high-profile anti-vaxxers is Diana Sosoaca, a member of the Romanian Senate. In one of her many public stunts she tried to block people from entering a vaccine center in her constituency in the northeast of the country.  \"If you love your children, stop the vaccinations,\" she says in a video clip on her Facebook page. \"Don\\'t kill them!\"  The most important way of stopping another Covid surgeThe vaccines on offer in Romania have been extensively tested for use in children and have proven to be safe and effective, but that hasn\\'t stopped her and others from spreading wild rumors on social media and local television.     Officials and medical personnel are exasperated that public figures have done so much to undermine their efforts.  \"Look at the reality,\" said Col. Dr. Valeriu Gheorghita, an army doctor who runs the national vaccination campaign. \"We have our intensive care units full of patients. We have lots of new cases. We have, unfortunately, hundreds of deaths every day. So this is the reality. And more than 90% of patients who died were unvaccinated.\"  A banner in Bucharest shows medics working on Covid-19 patients with this message: \"They\\'re suffocating. They\\'re begging us. They\\'re regretting.\"In Bucharest, a huge banner has gone up, covering half the fa챌ade of a building on a major boulevard. \"They\\'re suffocating. They\\'re begging us. They\\'re regretting,\" are the words printed in massive black letters above black-and-white photographs of medics struggling over Covid patients in an intensive care unit.  Down below, few passers-by glance up at the poster, and even fewer cared to share their thoughts with CNN. Soon, however, that banner will go up in other major cities in the country.   \"There\\'s manipulation,\" said a woman who gave her name only as Claudia, adding: \"Some people don\\'t believe in the vaccines.\" Mayor: \\'It\\'s not a safe vaccine\\'Nowhere is that suspicion more apparent than in the countryside, where Covid-19 vaccination rates plummet to about half of those in urban areas.   Suceava County, an hour\\'s flight northeast of Bucharest, has the lowest overall vaccination rate in the country.   Here, the manager of the main hospital, Dr. Alexandru Calancea, 40, talks about the particularity of this region, where he was born and bred.   Austria announces Europe\\'s first nationwide vaccine mandate and reimposes lockdown as Covid-19 soars \"This county is very religious. This is an area that has a strong religious tradition, and a lot of religious people. [...] Very few [priests] are pro-vaccine, and I definitely know some who are anti-vax. Most of them choose not to say anything, either for or against. We have proof, from the hospital, from patients who come from the same religious communities, where their priest, or their pastor, has advised them to not get vaccinated, just like that.\"  Just outside Suceava, in the village of Bosanci, such a pastor also serves as the village mayor. Neculai Miron has been one of the most vocal anti-vax public figures in the country, and today is no different. \"We\\'re not against vaccination, but we want to verify it, to satisfy our worries, because there have been many side effects,\" he told CNN. \"We don\\'t think that the vaccine components are very safe. It\\'s not a safe vaccine.\"  Neculai Miron, mayor of the village of Bosanci, in Suceava County, is vocal about his views against the vaccine -- he thinks it\\'s not safe.The medical data doesn\\'t sway him, and neither does the local GP, whom he took the CNN team to see.   Dr. Daniela Afadaroaie administers the vaccine to about 10 people every other day, using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The latest official records show that just under 11% of the village was vaccinated as of early November 2021. While she talked about the situation in the village, the mayor, Miron, hovered around the doctor\\'s desk, peering down at the papers on her desk to see who had been vaccinated.  \"When are you going to get vaccinated, Mr. Mayor?\" asked Afadaroaie, laughing.   \"I don\\'t need to get vaccinated,\" he shot back. \"I\\'m perfectly healthy.\" The doctor\\'s explanation that the vaccine helps keep you that way fell on deaf ears.   Pastor: \\'I believe what I see, rather than what I hear\\'In rural villages like this, poverty and lack of education, together with local leaders\\' personal influence and traditional religious beliefs, can make for a deadly combination. But the local Pentecostal pastor, Dragos Croitoru, insisted he was unaware of any deaths from Covid-19 in the parish. \"Here in the church, we don\\'t have any cases of people who are sick with coronavirus. We have a zero percent mortality rate, I don\\'t know anyone who\\'s died of coronavirus here in our parish. And I believe what I see, rather than what I hear,\" he said.   Despite hearing from CNN about the bodies of Covid-19 victims filling the morgue at Bucharest University Hospital, Croitoru was unconvinced. \"Bucharest is bigger than Bosanci, as far as I know,\" he chuckled. \"We haven\\'t had any dead. Maybe we\\'ve had a few people who have been ill in the village, yes, as far as I know, yes. But the mortality rate in our church has been zero.\"    The mortality rate is certainly high elsewhere in this mostly rural county. Suceava ranked third highest in Covid-19 mortality rates for the whole country as of early November, according to figures from the Public Health Unit, which monitors deaths.   Freshly laid graves at the biggest graveyard in Suceava, in northeast Romania, which has the third-highest Covid-19 mortality rate in the country.A corner of the main cemetery in Suceava, the county seat that\\'s about 10 minutes from Bosanci, is full of freshly dug graves. In the cemetery\\'s chapel, a service is underway.  On the hill behind the chapel, mourners gather for a funeral. Nearby, another grave is being prepared.   The wooden crosses over each new grave don\\'t indicate the cause of death, so it\\'s unclear how many died from the virus. A man working on one of the graves, however, said the number of people being buried of late was far higher than usual.  \"Eternal regrets,\" reads a ribbon draped across one of the graves.  Back in the morgue of the Bucharest University Hospital, a medic hammered a nail into a wooden coffin. A colleague sprayed the coffin with disinfectant.   For those who die of Covid, there will be no open-casket funerals.  \"The vaccine means the difference between life and death,\" said Ionita, the nurse. \"People should understand that. Maybe in their last hour they should understand that.\"For those shrouded in the black body bags before him, it is already too late. ',\n",

The bus driver was among the dead, according to Bulgarian National Television (BNT).After initially reporting 46 deaths, authorities later said it was unclear whether 45 or 46 people had died, BNT reported.Authorities said seven people -- two women and five men -- who were traveling in the back of the bus survived by breaking the windows to escape. They have been taken to Pirogov emergency hospital in Sofia and are in stable condition.Read MoreAuthorities added that identification of the dead would be difficult as the bodies were severely damaged by the fire, BNT reported. Emergency services on the scene of the crash early Tuesday. Bulgarian Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov, who visited the crash site, told reporters he saw bodies \"clustered inside\" and \"burnt to ash.\" He said \"the picture is terrifying,\" adding \"I have never seen anything like this before.\" The cause of the accident was unclear but the bus appeared to have hit a highway barrier either before or after it caught fire, Bulgarian officials said.Footage from Nova TV Bulgaria showed the charred remains of the bus on the side of the highway, with the mangled barrier wedged beneath the vehicle. Emergency responders were seen standing near fire trucks and a police van while an investigator in a white protective suit surveyed the scene taking photographs. Behind the vehicle, damage to the center divider was visible with debris strewn across both sides of the highway. Speaking alongside Rashkov, the director of Bulgaria\\'s National Investigation Service, Borislav Sarafov, called the incident \"a huge tragedy\" and offered his condolences to the families of the victims. Sarafov said the bus was one of four belonging to a tourist company from North Macedonia that entered Bulgaria late Monday from Turkey, BNT reported. The bus was returning to Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, from Istanbul -- a journey of around 800 km (500 miles) -- when the accident occurred. At this stage in the investigation, Sarafov said officials were exploring two possible causes of the accident. \"One is a human error of the bus driver, the second is a sudden technical malfunction, which led to the accident,\" he said, according to BNT. BNT reported that Rashkov added: \"There is a guardrail here, which was simply taken away, which means that most likely for some reason the bus went to the right in the direction of travel and came into contact with the guardrail, which was simply destroyed. We heard all sorts of versions, including a fuel leak. I hope it will be clarified very soon and the colleagues from the investigation will do their job.\"Authorities will also be investigating the stretch of highway where the accident occurred, which is prone to traffic incidents, according to BNT.

Her hands were burnt but otherwise fine,\" he told Reuters outside the hospital. \"She didn\\'t say much, she was crying and she was in shock. I only saw her through the door as due to COVID, they did not let me into the room.\"Some relatives gathered outside the Besa Trans agency in Skopje, whose Facebook page advertised twice-weekly trips to Istanbul, and which Yasharovski said ran the trip. The office was closed and its representatives could not be reached for comment.\"This is a huge tragedy,\" North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev told reporters in Sofia and expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims. Zaev said the passengers were all from North Macedonia but appeared to include a Serbian citizen and a Belgian citizen.

The clashes near the European Commission headquarters came after Belgium on Wednesday tightened its coronavirus restrictions -- including broadening mask use and working from home -- amid surging cases.Neighboring France is also experiencing a rise in Covid-19 infection rates, though President Emmanuel Macron has said a lockdown of the unvaccinated is \"not necessary\" given the country\\'s use of a \"health pass\" to access a wide variety of establishments.Elsewhere Austria on Monday became the first European Union country to go back into full lockdown this autumn amid a record number of cases. Last week Austria\\'s seven-day incidence rate passed 1,000 per 1000,000 inhabitants for the first time during the pandemic, according to the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES).Austria now plans to become the first European nation to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for all eligible people from February 1, according to its Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.In a desperate attempt to encourage people to get their jabs, Austria\\'s public broadcaster ORF said Monday it is offering a \"vaccination lottery\" to eligible residents -- with prizes including a family house, an electric car and smart TVs.Austria announces Europe\\'s first nationwide vaccine mandate and reimposes lockdown as Covid-19 soars Austria is not alone.

Spahn told a press conference in Berlin he was certain that by the end of this winter, everyone in Germany would be \"vaccinated, recovered or dead,\" in relation to the Delta variant. The country now plans to introduce targeted Covid-19 restrictions on the unvaccinated.Even Ireland, which has one of Europe\\'s highest vaccination rates -- with around 90% of eligible people immunized -- has not been spared the continent\\'s surge in cases. Last week the country imposed a midnight curfew on bars, restaurants and nightclubs as it faces a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections.While the European Union as a whole has been a world leader on inoculations -- more than 76% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the ECDC -- the rollout has been extremely unequal across the bloc. On the eastern side, Romania and Bulgaria have fully vaccinated only 43% and 29% of their adults, respectively.A CNN team last week witnessed dozens of bodies in black plastic bags piled up in corridors of one hospital in Bucharest as the facility struggled with the influx of deaths caused by the virus.Medical workers and officials in Romania attribute the low vaccination rate to a variety of factors, including suspicion of the authorities, deeply held religious beliefs, and a flood of misinformation surging through social media.Protests turn violent  Fresh Covid-19 restrictions sparked violent protests across some European cities at the weekend, as many citizens face the prospect of their second Christmas under lockdown. Along with Brussels, rioting broke out at The Hague on Saturday over the Dutch government\\'s new coronavirus measures.

              " ' (CNN)Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko\\'s willful manipulation of migrants, enabling their easy passage to and through his country toward the border of the European Union, is a classic assault on democracy by an autocrat who knows that any attempt to fight back risks undermining the bloc\\'s sacred values.Lukashenko denies the condemnation made by the G7 group of the world\\'s wealthiest democracies that he is orchestrating \"irregular migration\" in an \"aggressive and exploitative\" campaign -- just as he rejects the European Union\\'s accusation that his re-election as president last year, his sixth consecutive five-year term, was a sham.Not for nothing is the aging autocrat known outside of Belarus as Europe\\'s last dictator.The victims of the Belarus border crisis were obvious. For Poland\\'s government, it was a useful distractionFor much of this month, the world watched as weary migrants, some with small children and mainly from the Middle East, were coaxed and coerced in freezing conditions to a forest border with the EU. Their rising anger at not being allowed to cross erupted at times as they hurled volleys of rocks at Polish border guards who eventually spewed water cannon fire back at them.In a revealing interview with CNN last week, Lukashenko\\'s foreign minister, Vladimir Makei, exposed the psychology behind his boss\\'s decision to launch a frontal attack on Europe\\'s borders. \"Belarus has shown the dark side of the European democracy,\" he claimed.Polish police officers are seen on the Belarusian-Polish border. Read MoreUS President Joe Biden made it an early theme of his term in office, that democracy is under attack. \"We\\'re at an inflection point,\" he told an audience in Germany in February. \"We must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people in this changed world. That, in my view, is our galvanizing mission.\"But how to deliver on that mission is something that has yet to be mastered. Biden promised a \"summit of democracies\" \"early\" in his presidency, it is due to take place next month, although details are sketchy.  Biden\\'s leverage is waning among allies, due to diplomatic missteps such as the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan and the AUKUS security pact with Australia and the UK that marginalized France. Meanwhile, autocrats like Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin appear to be exploiting the opportunity to divide, discourage and sow dissent in the democracies closest to them, in Europe.When Belarusian foreign minister Makei told CNN that: \"Poland has violated all the possible international legal laws and democratic values,\" he turned logic on its head by ignoring Lukashenko\\'s autocratic practices, such as what some governments condemned as the illegal \"hijacking\" of a commercial airliner that was diverted to Minsk, and arresting a Belarus opposition activist who was on board.Cynically crying wolf, while wilfully ignoring their own violations is a convenience that autocracies routinely use to cover their tracks. Migrants collect their belongings before leaving a camp on the Belarusian-Polish border in the Grodno region and heading towards the Polish border crossing in Kuznica on November 15.On the face of it, how can the EU that champions human rights turn its back on migrants, less still turn water cannons on them? Human Rights groups have criticized Poland for preventing journalists from having access to the border region, and for allegedly pushing migrants who had successfully made it across the razor wire fence back into Belarus.  It is the caring side of democracy, that values human rights and decency, that Biden and others fear autocracies exploit. At one point last week, Lukashenko\\'s government proposed that Germany should take in 2,000 migrants and Belarus would handle the rest.According to Lukashenko\\'s foreign minister, both his boss and Putin were pushing Merkel into some sort of deal. \"It was President Putin who tried to contribute to the settlement of this crisis. He had conversations with Chancellor Merkel, he had conversations with President Lukashenko and as a result of these conversations, the phone calls between Merkel and Lukashenko were organized.\"Tensions are rising on the Poland-Belarus border. Here\\'s what you need to knowWhatever the detail of those conversations, Merkel and her EU partners saw through the ruse and refused to play ball. Germany\\'s Interior Minister Horst Seehofer later said firmly: \"We will not take in refugees. We will not bow to the pressure and say: \\'We are taking refugees into European countries,\\' because this would mean implementing the very basis of this perfidious strategy.\" This, it turns out, is not \"the dark side of the European democracy,\" as Makei claims, but the EU\\'s reality check on what it sees as Lukashenko\\'s lies.But will that matter for Lukashenko and Putin? Of course not. They thrive in a hybrid of hubris and confusion where doubt replaces certainty, and besmirching democracy\\'s moral purpose is a victory in and of itself.Exploiting democracyWhile the fabricated crisis has -- so far -- failed to divide the EU, little of what\\'s happened is a waste for the two autocrats, in that it helps prop up their own illegitimate rule. For their home audiences, the whipped-up confection of half truths about alleged mistreatment by border guards and their water cannons is enough to mislead some people into believing that the other side is no better than them.Lukashenko is exploiting democracy\\'s core value -- compassion -- by weaponizing migrant trauma to turn the EU\\'s moral strength to vulnerability. Europe\\'s real weakness, that he appears to assess, is not its physical borders but its principles.

To fight off his assault on democracy, the EU is forced into taking a firm stand and rejecting the 2,000 migrants. It is logical, but only borderline moral. It stoops toward Lukashenko\\'s level and treats those desperate people as pawns.It is this often complicated issue that Biden wants us to explore by illuminating what democracy has at stake in the fight ahead.Inside the European Union, the main effect of Lukashenko\\'s machinations will be to risk raising the specter of migrants at the border even beyond the pre-existing vexing reality -- a situation that has already fueled populist nationalism.At his inaugural address Biden used the word democracy five times in his introduction, and 11 times during his whole speech. It was at the forefront of his mind as he spoke at the spot where, just two weeks earlier, the United States\\' first attempted coup had unfolded.  Looking out on Washington\\'s flag-strewn Mall, his words broadcast into millions of living rooms and autocrats\\' offices around the world, Biden warned: \"We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile.\" It has become even clearer since then that democracy\\'s trials are far from over, both in the United States and around the world.

Video from the scene shows riot police deploying water cannons and charging groups of demonstrators.  The Netherlands re-entered three weeks of partial lockdown last Saturday and is now planning to ban unvaccinated people from entering some venues. Five police officers were injured during the clashes at The Hague, with one taken to hospital suffering concussion and two suffering hearing damage from loud fireworks, police said in a statement. \"The group started fires, committed destruction, assaulted motorists and threw rocks and heavy fireworks at police officers,\" police said, confirming that 19 arrests were made.Read MoreThey added that one demonstrator threw a stone through the window of an ambulance, which was transporting a patient to a hospital.Thousands of protesters attended a largely peaceful march in the capital Amsterdam on Saturday. Dutch public broadcaster, NOS also reported rioting in the town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province. The protests follow violent clashes on Friday night in the port city of Rotterdam, during which police were forced to fire gunshots to disperse the crowd, and 51 people were arrested. Anti-lockdown protesters hold torches in Vienna, Austria on Saturday.Elsewhere, an estimated 40,000 people on Saturday crowded the streets of Vienna in the country\\'s biggest coronavirus-related protest to date. Police tried to de-escalate the protest and when the \"mood was about to tip,\" they stopped fining those not wearing facemasks, Franz Eigner, Vice President of the Vienna police said during a press conference on Sunday. Some police officers had \"unidentified liquid\" sprayed on them, and protesters were trying to blind a helicopter with a laser, Eigner said. A small number of protesters were \"extremely prone to violence,\" Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said during the press conference, which he associated with the \"right-wing extremist scene.\"Europe is learning a crucial lesson -- vaccines work, but they alone won\\'t stop Covid nowAustria will re-introduce a nationwide partial lockdown on Monday and make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory from February next year.  More than 1,400 police officers were deployed across the country to maintain public order, according to a police statement. Pepper spray was used in one \"heated\" protest in central Vienna, the police statement added. France sent dozens of elite police and counter-terrorism officers to its Caribbean island of Guadeloupe Saturday following looting and arson overnight in defiance of an overnight curfew.

Alexander Zverev celebrates with the ATP Finals trophy.\"He definitely can win a grand slam because it\\'s just obvious, but he\\'s not the only one. That\\'s where it gets tough. He was in the semis in the US Open and lost in five sets [to Djokovic in 2021]. Who knows, maybe if he was in the final, he would beat me.\"It\\'s just a matter of every tournament is a different scenario, different surface. You need to win seven matches to be a Grand Slam champion. Is he capable? Yes. Is he going to do it? We never know.\"But breaking the stranglehold that Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have on the four grand slams has proven difficult for the entire new generation of stars, even with the \\'Big Three\\' in the twilight of their careers.Medvedev\\'s win at the recent US Open was the first time one of the \\'Next Gen\\' players, comprised of the likes of Zverev, Thiem, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Andrey Rublev, had won a grand slam with one of Djokovic, Nadal or Federer present in the closing rounds.Thiem\\'s victory at the 2020 US Open came after Djokovic was disqualified in the fourth round for hitting a line judge with a ball.Australian Open and ongoing allegationsThe first grand slam of 2022, January\\'s Australian Open, may well present Zverev with one of his best chances of a slam.Federer has already confirmed that he will not be competing as he recovers from knee surgery, while Djokovic\\'s participation remains uncertain due to questions surrounding his vaccination status.Only Nadal of the \\'Big Three\\' is confirmed to be playing, but after an injury layoff of several months and just two planned warm up tournaments the Spaniard might not immediately be back to his best.As proven at the ATP Finals with wins over world No. 1 Djokovic and No. 2 Medvedev, Zverev is capable of beating the very best on his day. The only remaining question is whether he can overcome the mental hurdle of producing when it matters in a grand slam.Sunday\\'s win was an important one in that regard, too, as Zverev halted a five-game losing streak against Medvedev, including a defeat in the round robin earlier in the tournament.Daniil Medvedev won his first grand slam at the US Open.\"You beat me five times in a row, so thank you for letting me win once as well,\" Zverev joked during the trophy presentation.\"I won the World Tour Finals in the final against a player I lost five times in a row to, so I had to play one of my best matches,\" he added. \"I\\'m happy about that and happy to be going on holiday with this win. There\\'s no better way to end the season than winning here. I\\'m obviously incredibly happy but I\\'m also very much looking forward to next year already.\"Away from the court, Zverev has continued to face domestic abuse allegations made his ex-girlfriend, Olya Sharypova.In an interview with Slate in August, Sharypova accused him of physically and emotionally abusing her at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai in 2019.Zverev was asked about the allegations at a press conference prior to the 2021 US Open in August and he denied the allegations.\"I\\'ve always said that the allegations and everything that has been said is untrue,\" he said.',\n",

Referee Ruddy Buquet instructed the teams to go to their respective dressing rooms after Payet had received treatment and Lyon\\'s players attempted to calm the atmosphere. It did look like the game might restart though. The stadium announcer said the game would resume but warned a further incident would lead to the game being abandoned. Lyon\\'s players took the field to warm up, but the Marseille squad remained in their dressing room. Read MoreAfter a wait of almost two hours, at approximately 10:45 p.m. local time, the game was abandoned. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said on the club\\'s official Twitter account: \"We send (Payet) our apologies.\"Payet leaves the field after having received treatment from being hit by a water bottle thrown from the stands during the Lyon and Marseille match. \"The perpetrator was immediately reported and caught. It\\'s an isolated act,\" Aulas continued. \"After a rather long discussion, a decision was taken by Mr. Buquet. When there are 55,000 people in a stadium, precautions must be taken. The referee summoned everyone a second time to announce that he had changed his mind.\"The match was postponed after an hour and a half. Our players followed Mr. Buquet\\'s orders by returning to warm up. Then the referee changed his mind so they returned to the locker room. They wisely waited for the decision and acceded to it. The perpetrator has been arrested. The individual in question was isolated. It is a pity that a generality has been drawn from that.\"The Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) released a statement in which it called the incident a \"cowardly attack,\" as well as saying Payet was also a victim of \"insults of a discriminatory nature.\"\"Despite the firmness of the decisions of the LFP\\'s Disciplinary Commission since the start of the season (points deductions, matches behind closed doors, stands closed) and the work put in with the government in order to sanction more effectively violent individuals in the stadiums, these new serious incidents act as a reminder that the security of matches is the responsibility of the host club and local authorities, to whom the final decision falls as to whether a match will restart or be definitively stopped,\" it said.\"At a time when Ligue 1 Uber Eats is becoming increasingly attractive on the pitches, these serious and repeated incidents are destroying the image of the league in France and internationally.\"After an emergency meeting of the LFP\\'s Disciplinary Commission on Monday in light of the \"new and extremely serious incidents,\" it was announced that matches played at Lyon\\'s Groupama Stadium should be played in front of no fans until the Commission makes its final decision on the matter on Wednesday, December 8.It means Lyon\\'s game against Stade de Reims scheduled for Wednesday, December 1 would be affected by this measure.

Peng, 35, one of China\\'s most recognizable athletes, accused former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex, according to screenshots of a since-deleted social media post dated November 2.Chinese censors wiped out any mention of the accusation online and blocked her Weibo account from search results.Attempts by China to show Peng is safe -- including an email purportedly from Peng and several video clips of the athlete -- have only added to the concern over her safety. On Sunday, the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach held a video phone call with Peng. Read MoreSome of the sport\\'s biggest names have called on China to confirm her safety and investigate her allegations. Women\\'s Tennis Association (WTA) Chairman and CEO Steve Simon has threatened to pull out of China if Peng is not accounted for and her accusations not properly investigated. Here\\'s what you need to know about the accusation -- and the evolving fallout.Who is Peng Shuai?Peng is a two-time Grand Slam doubles champion and one of China\\'s top tennis players.From Hunan, in central China, the 35-year-old made history in 2014 when she became the first Chinese player -- male or female -- to achieve the world No.1 doubles ranking. Chinese tennis star accuses former top Communist Party leader of sexual assault, triggering blanket censorshipHer two major doubles titles were won at Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014. Peng also reached the singles semifinals at the 2014 US Open, and is a three-time Olympian. She\\'s won 25 tour titles and obtained a No. 17 world singles rank.The international success of Peng and fellow Chinese tennis stars Li Na and Zheng Jie, has been credited with helping the sport\\'s popularity soar in China, particularly for the women\\'s game. Who is Zhang Gaoli and what accusations has Peng leveled?Zhang Gaoli, 75, served on the ruling Communist Party\\'s seven-person Politiburo Standing Committee -- the country\\'s supreme leadership body -- from 2012 to 2017 during Chinese leader Xi Jinping\\'s first term in power. He retired as vice premier in 2018.In a since-deleted social media post dated November 2, Peng accused Zhang of coercing her into sex and alleges a relationship over an intermittent period that spanned at least 10 years.About three years ago, after Zhang had retired, the post alleges Peng was invited by him to play tennis in Beijing. Afterward, she wrote, Zhang and his wife brought Peng to their home, where Peng claimed she was pressured into having sex with Zhang.\"That afternoon I did not agree at first and was crying all the time,\" Peng wrote. After dinner with Zhang and his wife, and following much persuading from Zhang, she relented, according to the post.Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli speaks during the Belt and Road Forum on May 14, 2017 in Beijing, China.\"Why did you have to come back to me, took me to your home to force me to have sex with you?\" she wrote.\"I couldn\\'t describe how disgusted I was, and how many times I asked myself am I still a human? I feel like a walking corpse. Every day I was acting, which person is the real me?\" Peng said she did not have evidence to prove her allegations, and claimed Zhang was always worried that she would record things. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the more than 1,600-word post.What has happened to her?Peng\\'s explosive #MeToo allegation prompted China\\'s censors to respond at an unprecedented level.Her post on Weibo, China\\'s Twitter-like platform, was deleted within 30 minutes of publication, and censors scrubbed any mention of the accusation online. Her Weibo account, which has more than half a million followers, is still blocked from searchers on the platform.For almost three weeks following the accusation, Peng was not seen in public and her whereabouts were not publicly disclosed.CNN has repeatedly reached out for comment to both her and China\\'s State Council, which handles press inquires for the central government. WTA chief Simon told CNN he had been in conversation with counterparts at the Chinese Tennis Association, who had provided assurances Peng was unharmed in Beijing. However, attempts to reach Peng directly had proved unsuccessful, he said. ReappearanceNew video clips of the tennis star were tweeted by members of Chinese state media on November 20 and 21. One clip appears to show Peng sitting with China Open tournament co-director Zhang Junhui and two women around a table in a restaurant in Beijing. The clips appear to deliberately emphasize specific dates. Throughout the video, Zhang is speaking to Peng, but she doesn\\'t say anything.On Sunday, members of Chinese state media released more videos on social media purporting to show Peng at a tennis event for teenagers in Beijing. Throughout the videos Peng says very little but is seen smiling. CNN cannot independently verify the two video clips or confirm when they were filmed.Then later on Sunday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced its President Thomas Bach held a video phone call with Peng. The two were accompanied on the call by a Chinese sports official, Li Lingwei, as well as the Chair of the Athletes\\' Commission, Emma Terho. The call, which reportedly lasted lasted 30 minutes, appears to be Peng\\'s first known direct contact with officials outside of China since making the allegations.The IOC statement said Peng thanked the committee for its concern about her well-being and insisted that she is \"safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time. That is why she prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now.\"However, the WTA said the video was not enough to \"alleviate or address the WTA\\'s concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion.\"What have authorities said?Chinese authorities have so far refused to publicly acknowledge Peng\\'s allegations against Zhang. Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in separate comments on November 17 and 18 the issue \"wasn\\'t a diplomatic matter,\" and declined to comment further to reporters. On November 17, Chinese state media released an email, purportedly sent to WTA\\'s Simon from Peng, walking back her allegations and claiming she is fine.Simon cast doubt on the email\\'s veracity, describing it as a \"staged statement of some type.\" He has demanded China provide \"independent and verifiable proof\" Peng is safe. Doubts cast on alleged email from tennis star Peng Shuai amid worries over her whereabouts\"Whether she was coerced into writing it, someone wrote it for her, we don\\'t know,\" he said. \"But at this point I don\\'t think there\\'s any validity in it and we won\\'t be comfortable until we have a chance to speak with her,\" he added.Peng\\'s disappearance sparked a wave of concern, including from the United Nations, the United States government, and Britain\\'s Foreign Office. The United Nations Human Rights Office has called for an investigation into her allegations of sexual assault.Some of the world\\'s top tennis players are speaking out using the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai. Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, Billie Jean King and Chris Evert are among those expressing shock and calling for her allegations to be investigated.What happens next?There is significant pressure on Chinese authorities to provide proof Peng is safe. WTA chief Simon said he is willing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business in China if she is not fully accounted for.\"We\\'re definitely willing to pull our business and deal with all the complications that come with it,\" Simon said in an interview on November 18 with CNN. \"Because this is certainly, this is bigger than the business,\" he added.And tennis in China is big business, with the WTA commitments alone amounting to about $1 billion.

Questions over veracityEarlier in the week, Chinese state media released an email, purportedly sent to Simon from Peng, walking back her allegations and claiming she is fine.The alleged email was released only on English-language platforms and domestic Chinese media have not reported on its contents, despite Peng being a household name in China.When asked about the email, Simon questioned its veracity, describing it as a \"staged statement of some type,\" noting he had yet to receive a follow-up reply, despite responding immediately.\"Whether she was coerced into writing it, someone wrote it for her, we don\\'t know,\" said Simon. \"But at this point I don\\'t think there\\'s any validity in it and we won\\'t be comfortable until we have a chance to speak with her,\" he added.Later on Friday, CGTN journalist Shen Shiwei tweeted three photos he claimed Peng had posted on WeChat along with the message \"happy weekend.\"Shen said the photos were shared by one of Peng\\'s friends. CNN could not independently verify when the photos were taken, whether Peng posted the photos herself, or whether they were posted at all.In a Twitter post on Saturday, Hu, of the Global Times republished the photos of Peng.\"I confirmed through my own sources today that these photos are indeed Peng Shuai\\'s current state.

              " ' (CNN)International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach held a video phone call with three-time Olympian Peng Shuai, the Olympics governing body announced on Sunday, amid a wave of global concern about Peng\\'s wellbeing and whereabouts.The two were accompanied on the video call by a Chinese sports official, Li Lingwei, as well as the Chair of the Athletes\\' Commission, Emma Terho. The IOC did not provide CNN access to the video. The video comes after Peng, one of China\\'s most recognizable sports stars, publicly accused former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex at his home, according to screenshots of a since-deleted social media post dated November 2. WTA chief says new video of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai \\'insufficient\\' to assure her safetyShe has not been directly seen in public since the accusation, prompting several fellow tennis players to express worry on social media, using the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai. The Women\\'s Tennis Association and the United Nations have called for an investigation into her allegations of sexual assault.Read MoreAccording to the IOC statement, Peng thanked the committee for its concern about her well-being and insisted that she is \"safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time. That is why she prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now.\"The call, which reportedly lasted 30-minutes, appears to be Peng\\'s first known direct contact with officials outside of China since making the allegations. \"I was relieved to see that Peng Shuai was doing fine, which was our main concern,\" said Terho. \"She appeared to be relaxed. I offered her our support and to stay in touch at any time of her convenience, which she obviously appreciated.\"Also according to the IOC, Peng accepted an invitation to have dinner with Bach and Terho as well as Li -- a former director and Communist Party secretary of Tennis Administration Center of General Administration of Sport of China -- in January, ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics.  The IOC told CNN on Monday that the video call was to enquire about the \"wellbeing and safety\" of the Chinese tennis star.In a statement, an IOC spokesperson said: \"In the 30-minute conversation, she was very clear in confirming that she is safe and well. She also mentioned that she will be taking part in some activities with friends and family, and will continue to be involved in tennis.\"\"Safeguarding the well-being of athletes is paramount to the IOC and the Olympic Movement,\" the spokesperson added.\"We also made it clear that she could get in touch whenever she deems it appropriate, and we will also continue to remain in contact with the Chinese Olympic Committee,\" read the statement.Following the IOC statement saying Bach had spoken with Peng, a spokesperson for the WTA said it was not enough to \"alleviate or address the WTA\\'s concern.\"\"It was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don\\'t alleviate or address the WTA\\'s concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion,\" the spokesperson told CNN in a statement. \"This video does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.\"Steve Simon, the head of the WTA, has also called for more robust proof of Peng\\'s liberty. In a letter to China\\'s Ambassador to the United States Qin Gang, Simon requests that she either be allowed to leave the country or speak live via teleconference with him and no one else present.The IOC did not provide a response when asked by CNN about criticism from the WTA that Sunday\\'s video call failed to alleviate or address concerns about Peng\\'s \"well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion.\"Simon\\'s demand came as several people connected to Chinese state media and sport system tweeted photos and videos they say show Peng out to dinner on Saturday and at a tennis event for teenagers in Beijing on Sunday. Throughout the videos Peng says very little but is seen smiling. CNN cannot independently verify the video clips or confirm when they were filmed.Though Simon expressed relief at seeing Peng in these clips, he said his concerns remained.\"It remains unclear if she is free and able to make decisions and take actions on her own, without coercion or external interference,\" Simon said.What Peng Shuai\\'s disappearance means for upcoming Beijing OlympicsPeng\\'s explosive sexual assault allegations, made in a post on Weibo, China\\'s Twitter-like platform, were deleted within 30 minutes of publication, and any mention of the accusation online was quickly erased. Until Chinese state media released the videos over the weekend, Peng had not been seen in public for about three weeks, leading to global outcry. Beijing faced growing international pressure to show proof of her well-being, including from the United Nations, the US government, and the world\\'s biggest tennis stars.Simon, the WTA chief, said he is willing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business in China if Peng is not fully accounted for and her allegations not properly investigated.Chinese authorities have not acknowledged Peng\\'s allegations against Zhang, and there is no indication an investigation is underway. It remains unclear if Peng has reported her allegations to the police.Speaking at a news conference Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reiterated that Peng\\'s accusation is not a diplomatic issue and declined to comment further. CNN has reached out to China\\'s State Council Information Office, which handles press inquires for the central government.Zhang has kept a low profile and faded from public life since his retirement in 2018, and there is no public information relating to his current whereabouts.Previous reporting contributed by CNN\\'s Nectar Gan and Mohammed Tawfeeq.',\n",

              " ' (CNN)It was clear who the losers were in the dispute between Poland and Belarus. The thousands of migrants who became stranded on the border in freezing conditions had their dreams of a new future in Europe dashed, and some are now being repatriated to their home countries. But for Poland\\'s government, the crisis helped to divert attention from a series of uncomfortable issues.The nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), which won an outright majority in 2015, has seen its grip on parliamentary power weaken in the years since. It is also roiled in conflict with the European Commission over the rule of law and faces wide opposition, especially in urban areas, to its position on cultural issues.Earlier this month, the death of a pregnant Polish woman reignited debate over the country\\'s near total ban on abortion, with protesters again taking to the streets.Set against this backdrop, the drama that played out on the country\\'s eastern border with Belarus -- while unsolicited by Poland and serious for all involved -- can be seen as a helpful distraction for the ruling PiS.

And they have been in trouble for quite a time already, with the parliamentary majority becoming slimmer and slimmer,\" Piotr Buras, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations\\' Warsaw office, told CNN. Read MoreThe right-wing party\\'s ruling coalition narrowly controlled the lower house, the Sejm, until the summer, when three MPs defected, costing PiS its formal majority and forcing it to rely on the support of independents. The party had already lost control of Poland\\'s upper house in 2019 elections, and President Andrzej Duda, backed by PiS, only narrowly won a second term last year.Meanwhile, rising inflation is causing financial pain for many in Poland, and polling indicates support for the government has dropped in recent weeks, said Buras.\"I don\\'t want to play down the situation because it is risky and serious, quite a difficult political situation because it involves a security conflict and a humanitarian crisis... but there is of course also an attempt to capitalize politically on this crisis,\" he said.Judy Dempsey, editor of the Strategic Europe blog for the thinktank Carnegie Europe, agreed that the crisis had been \"playing out very well\" for the ruling party.Support for the government had fallen, she said, amid protests over the death of the pregnant woman. But Dempsey added: \"With this whole crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border, Law and Justice now is seen as a champion of protecting Polish sovereignty and, of course, protecting Europe.\" Photos: The Poland-Belarus border crisisMigrants settle for the night on Thursday, November 18, in a warehouse near the Bruzgi-Ku탄nica crossing serving as an ad hoc processing center.Hide Caption 1 of 32 Photos: The Poland-Belarus border crisisThe area near the boarder that served as a makeshift camp is deserted after border guards have moved the migrants to the warehouse.

That has not always worked to the Polish government\\'s benefit: Some of the most compelling images of the crisis, such as Polish border forces using water cannons on desperate migrants, were captured from the Belarusian side of the border, where international journalists were able to operate. The government is now trying to pass legislation that would give it new powers when the state of emergency expires next month.The crisis has also forced the EU to rally behind for Poland at a time of increasingly bitter dispute between the European Commission and Poland over the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.Late last month, the European Union\\'s top court ordered Poland to pay a daily fine of ?? million ($1.2 million) for failing to suspend a disciplinary chamber for judges that the bloc says breaches EU law, just the latest in a series of conflicts.Now, the European Commission and key European powers are speaking out in support of Poland as the defender of the bloc\\'s eastern border.

Nonetheless, the political situation is \"very volatile,\" he added, and the Polish government risks finding itself hemmed in by its fierce rhetoric on border security and unable to back down.If the crisis abates, with migrants repatriated or no longer on the border, the extent to which the Polish government continues to benefit from the nationalistic fervor it has whipped up will depend in part on how effective the opposition is, Dempsey said.Another factor to consider is those within Poland who do not share the government\\'s desire to keep the migrants out, she said.\"We mustn\\'t forget that there are civil society movements and nongovernmental organizations and decent people who want these migrants treated properly, (want) access to the border to give them help,\" she said. \"Maybe this will backfire. The Polish government kept a lid on the reporting and didn\\'t allow humanitarian agencies or the media to go to the border. So if this crisis does weaken, no doubt Law and Justice will try to keep the nationalist fervor going, but it cannot be sustained.\"EU backs Poland on bordersThe clear losers in this crisis are the migrants, mostly from the Middle East, who paid large sums to traffickers on the false promise of an easy way to cross illegally into Poland and travel on deeper into Europe in search of a better life.They gave up everything to get to Europe. Now hundreds are being sent homeAn unlucky few have died of cold in the freezing forests along Belarus\\' border. Others have opted to return home having gained nothing except debt; an Iraqi Airways evacuation flight left Thursday from Minsk carrying more than 400 Iraqis back to the cities of Erbil and Baghdad.Belarusian border guards moved some migrants to shelter in a warehouse after tensions on the border flared into skirmishes Tuesday. The remainder followed on Thursday, leaving behind only remnants of the makeshift camp by the Bruzgi-Kuznica crossing where 2,000 or more people had been camped out.Lukashenko\\'s spokeswoman, Natalya Eismont, said Thursday that about 7,000 migrants were in Belarus. Those who remain insist on a humanitarian corridor being opened to Western Europe, primarily to Germany, Eismont said, according to Belarus state news agency BelTA.According to the Polish Border Guard, there have been more than 35,000 attempts to cross illegally into Poland from Belarus since the beginning of August. Seven people had been found dead on the Polish side of the border as of Thursday.Poland has been criticized by international aid organizations who say it is breaching international law by pushing asylum seekers who make it over the border back into Belarus, instead of accepting their applications for international protection. Poland stands by its actions, however, saying they are legal.Meanwhile, some who have made it over the border into Poland have alleged brutal treatment at the hands of Belarusian security forces.Western officials have accused Belarusian strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko of manufacturing the crisis to destabilize the bloc as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses. The unanswered question is what Belarus now stands to gain from the standoff on the EU\\'s eastern frontier.EU leaders agreed Monday to impose a new package of sanctions on Belarus targeting \"everyone involved\" in facilitating the situation on Poland\\'s border, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said.The EU has also made clear its assistance will extend to humanitarian aid and help for migrants to return home -- but not to resettlement within its borders. In a phone call Wednesday with Lukashenko, Merkel underlined the need to ensure \"humanitarian care and return opportunities\" for the people affected, her spokesman said.Germany\\'s caretaker Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has insisted that \"the EU will not be blackmailed by criminals like Lukashenko\" and says the bloc wants to find out the migrants\\' countries of origin in order to repatriate their citizens.Dempsey is critical of the EU response, saying the bloc failed to agree on a common, united policy on migration after the 2015 refugee crisis and is paying the price for it now.This crisis will doubtless be followed by another one, she said. \"Migrants or refugees looking for safety or a better life will be exploited again and the Europeans still will not put together a proper, humane, practical policy -- and pushing up very heavily fortified fences is not a solution.\"Fallout for BelarusSome observers have pointed to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the most important ally of Belarus, as being involved in stoking the turmoil. A buildup of Russian military forces near Ukraine\\'s eastern border has deepened concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis.Britain\\'s army chief warns risk of accidental war with Russia is greater than during Cold WarAsked about any threat of war in an interview published Thursday by German newspaper Bild, Morawiecki said he hoped all parties would remain calm, but added that nothing could be ruled out.\"Lukashenko and Putin are obviously following a strategy to unsettle the West, to destabilize it. We don\\'t know what else they are planning,\" the Polish Prime Minister told Bild. \"It is also possible that the crisis on the border is only meant to distract from new military attacks that Putin is preparing in Ukraine.\"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday strongly rejected any suggestion that Putin had been using so-called \"hybrid warfare\" tactics in Europe. \"Russia does not wage any hybrid wars. We absolutely rule this out,\" Peskov told journalists.Putin, too, has denied Russian involvement in the Belarus-Poland border crisis. \"We have absolutely nothing to do with it. Everyone is trying to impose responsibility on us for any reason and for no reason at all,\" Putin told state broadcaster Russia 24.JUST WATCHEDCamped against barbed wire and watched by dogs, a day on the Belarusian borderReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCamped against barbed wire and watched by dogs, a day on the Belarusian border 03:07Lukashenko\\'s government has also repeatedly rejected claims it manufactured the border crisis.Interviewed by CNN on Thursday, Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei said accusations by European nations that Belarus had orchestrated the standoff were a \"false assessment of the situation.\" He instead blamed the EU, saying migrants had heard about the \"privileges\" neighboring EU countries had offered \"migrants from Belarus\" -- a reference to opposition and dissidents who have fled Minsk since disputed elections last year.Radoslaw Sikorski, a member of the European Parliament and former Polish foreign minister and defense minister, told CNN\\'s Hala Gorani that Lukashenko\\'s gamble over the migrant crisis could backfire.\"Lukashenko is trying to repeat what President Erdogan of Turkey did, except that Turkey really had millions of Syrian refugees, and it really was a huge drain on Turkey\\'s resources, and that EU agreed to pay some of that cost. Mr. Lukashenko has imported his migrants on purpose,\" said Sikorski, who is also a senior fellow at Harvard.While Lukashenko would see the fact that he is receiving calls from Merkel as \"a success for him,\" Sikorski said, the crisis could eventually cost him more than any fleeting legitimacy he has gained. Actions taken by the EU and Middle East governments to stem the flow of migrants into Belarus are starting to have an effect and only small numbers are getting through to the EU, Sikorski said. \"I think, eventually, Lukashenko will have to conclude that it\\'s a bigger problem for him than for the European Union,\" he said.CNN\\'s Antonia Mortensen contributed reporting from Bialystok, Poland.

However, after his amazing performance, in which he carried the ball 32 times for 185 yards and the five TDs, Taylor stressed the importance of the whole offense, not just him. Read More\"The Colts\\' offensive identity is all of us all together,\" Taylor said. \"Everything that you saw today was the culmination of the defense getting the ball back to us, creating turnovers, and then the offense being on one accord -- being able to communicate no matter what front, what pressure they bring, being able to execute.\"Taylor celebrates a touchdown with Jack Doyle during the third quarter against the Bills.In his performance, Taylor not only propelled the Colts into the playoff hunt after the team\\'s slow start the season, he also racked up a host of personal milestones. With Derrick Henry -- the Tennessee Titans running back who had previously been leading the NFL in rushing yards -- injured, Taylor established himself as the league\\'s leading rusher with 1,122 yards. The 22-year-old also tied NFL Hall of Famer LaDainian Tomlinson and Lydell Mitchell with an NFL-record eight consecutive games of 100-plus scrimmage yards and one-plus rushing touchdown.Taylor became just the 18th player in NFL history to score five touchdowns, and his teammates are backing him for MVP this year. \"He\\'s sending a message to the league,\" fellow Colts running back Nyheim Hines said. \"It\\'s been amazing watching him play. \"Great to watch him finish runs and make people miss.

              " ' (CNN)Within hours of Manchester United announcing the sacking of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the hashtag \\'ThankYouOle\\' started trending. It was yet another reminder that, despite disappointing results, the club as a global brand seems to be as strong as ever, continuing to boast a social media following that is the envy of many sports entities worldwide. No club in the Premier League, for instance, can come close to matching United\\'s Twitter following of 28.5 million people -- league leader Chelsea comes closest with almost 10 million less. But winning the social media race will offer fans little consolation, with Solskjaer\\'s departure coming at a time when the club is falling further behind its rivals on the pitch.Last year\\'s runner-up is currently languishing in eighth after four losses in its last five league games and the team, particularly the defense, looks short of organization and structure. Read MoreFollowing a humiliating 4-1 defeat against Watford in Solskjaer\\'s last game on Sunday, United goalkeeper David de Gea summed it up by saying: \"We don\\'t know what to do with the ball, we are conceding a lot of goals. It\\'s a horrible moment.\"Solskjaer was hired to bring the good times back to Old Trafford and, at times, he did so. A Champions League win against PSG and derby victories against Manchester City have given fans memories to last but Solskjaer failed to deliver a trophy during his reign. Performances this season have also looked particularly poor, with recent defeats to Manchester City and Liverpool demonstrating the growing gap in quality between United and those realistically challenging for the title.In his first two seasons in charge, the manager could explain poor results away as the club being in a rebuilding process, but this season was different. The board had backed Solskjaer in the transfer market with the signings of Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and Cristiano Ronaldo, and there was simply no room for excuses when you had a squad bubbling over with elite talent. No one within the club has publicly questioned Solskjaer\\'s sincerity -- Ronaldo himself called his former manager an \"outstanding human being\" in a post on social media Monday -- but many have questioned his ability to coach at the highest level. The job for the next boss is getting a tune out of a team of world class individuals. \"I think there is potential in this club. We all love the club, and we all want to see it continue,\" Solskjaer said in his goodbye interview with the club, a video which attracted over 3.9 million views on Twitter.READ: Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta explains fiery clash with Jurgen Klopp during defeat to LiverpoolSolskjaer was unable to get a tune out of his world class players. What next? As has been the case for United\\'s hierarchy since the departure of Alex Ferguson in 2013, there seems to be little planned for life after the last manager. The club announced that Michael Carrick, Solskjaer\\'s right-hand man who has never taken charge of a Premier League game in his life, will fill in until an interim manager takes over until the end of the season.No one can deny Carrick was a brilliant player for the club, but questions remain on whether he can bring anything different to the table given his heavy involvement in Solskjaer\\'s term. The timing of this decision has hardly been great either, with many of the game\\'s top coaches already in jobs. United decided to sack Solskjaer almost three weeks after Antonio Conte, a potential replacement, was signed by Tottenham Hotspur.Ex-Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane and current PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino are being rumored as full-time replacements but United still has to navigate a tricky season with qualification to next year\\'s Champions League looking like an uphill struggle -- failure to do so will be a huge blow both on and off the pitch.

The Glazer owners and departing executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward have been accused of not caring enough about performances on the pitch, and they have once again been criticized for not having a plan in place.\"I don\\'t really want to stick the knife in today to the club\\'s owners and the club\\'s hierarchy but you have to ask serious questions. I\\'ve had enough of it,\" former United player Gary Neville told Sky Sports. \"I think the club is run, on a business side, okay but I think culturally and from the point of view of football decision-making, it leaves a lot to be desired.\"They\\'ve been caught out again, they\\'ve been caught out in the last few weeks, they\\'ve not known what to do.\"According to the Financial Times, the club aims to return to pre-pandemic annual revenues of more than $800m and, no doubt, its social media following will continue to grow.

              " 'London (CNN)Manchester United have confirmed the departure of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, one day after the club suffered a humiliating 4-1 Premier League defeat at Watford.Solskjaer has overseen a disappointing start to the season, with the club sitting in seventh place in the Premier League. They have lost four of their past five league matches, including a 5-0 home thumping at the hands of rivals Liverpool.The former United striker took over as an interim boss in 2018 and was subsequently given a permanent contract, but his position has been under scrutiny for several weeks.\"Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision,\" the club said in a statement. \"While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success.\"Read MoreAssistant coach Michael Carrick will take charge of the team for their upcoming fixtures, while the club searches for a permanent replacement for Solskjaer.United board mull successorsUnited\\'s recent downturn in form has seen the team lose seven of their last 13 matches, with Saturday\\'s chastening defeat to Watford the final straw for the club board.Solskjaer was initially drafted in from Norwegian side Molde in 2018 to right the ship after Jose Mourinho\\'s tumultuous tenure at the helm of the side. He was awarded a permanent contract after an impressive run of results as the team\\'s interim manager. Despite that early promise, however, Solskjaer was never able to lead the team to further success and he leaves having failed to win a trophy in his three years at the club.The pressure had been mounting on the Norwegian coach for several weeks, but the team was able to pull off big results when Solskjaer\\'s job was seemingly on the line.The board even stuck by the 48-year-old after last month\\'s embarrassing 5-0 defeat at home to bitter rivals Liverpool, with the team following up that result with a big 3-0 win at Tottenham.But that was as good as it would get for Solskjaer as United limped to a draw at Atalanta in the Champions League, before losing on home soil to Manchester City.\"Ole leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as Manager and our very best wishes for the future,\" the club said. \"His place in the club\\'s history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a Manager who gave us many great moments. \"He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family.\"The club will now look for Solskjaer\\'s successor, with former Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane and current Leicester City coach Brendan Rogers reportedly in the frame for the job.',\n",
              " ' (CNN)Most of the 250 permanent residents of a volcanic Italian island have been told to evacuate after levels of carbon dioxide in the air spiked dangerously, causing respiratory problems to people and their pets.Carbon dioxide levels around the volcanic island of Vulcano in the Aeolian archipelago off the north coast of Sicily have risen from 80 tons to 480 tons, effectively reducing the amount of oxygen in the air, according to the Italian National Institute for Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV). The gas levels started rising noticeably on October 21, when residents started reporting trouble breathing and health issues with their pets, which are often affected by decreased oxygen levels before humans.Marco Giorgianni, the mayor of Lipari, which includes all seven of the islands in the Aeolian archipelago, signed an ordinance ordering the evacuation of the port area and designating a \"red zone\" where non-researchers or non-civil protection officials are prohibited from staying. In so-called \"yellow zones,\" people can remain but will have to stay in the upper floors of their homes.Read MoreThe ordinance also prohibits all non-resident visitors and tourists from the island for one month. In a message on the Lipari Comune\\'s Facebook page, Giorgianni explained Sunday that the evacuation is not because of the threat of an imminent eruption, but because of the dangerous emission of gases. \"The activity of the volcano gives us reason in this moment to pay attention even if almost all of the data points to a condition of stability,\" he said, referring to volcanic activity. \"The data that motivated my ordinance is the increasing gas emissions.\" He added that authorities had been tracking gas emissions for the last month and they had risen to a level that is potentially dangerous for humans, especially at night when they are sleeping. \"My citizens must reside where the air is most secure and healthy in this region,\"  he said.According to INGV\\'s Palermo and Catania-Etneo Observatory website, four geochemical stations to measure CO2 from the soil are now operating. The observatory has also installed seven new seismic stations (six on Vulcano and one on Lipari) to supplement those already in place. A high-definition thermal cam has also been installed to monitor soil temperatures.According to the ordinance, residents will be given monthly allowances of ??00 for single households, ??00 for two-person households, ??00 for three person households and ??00 for households with more than four people to offset costs in finding alternative accommodation.Vulcano -- which is named after Vulcan, the god of fire, and from which the English word volcano is derived -- last erupted on March 22, 1890, according to the INGV.',\n",
              " ' (CNN)Thousands of people have been stranded at the border between Poland and Belarus for months, trapped at the center of an intensifying geopolitical dispute.The migrants -- most of whom are from the Middle East and Asia, and who are hoping to travel on from Poland deeper into Europe -- have been gathering on the Belarusian side of the Kuznica border crossing in terrible conditions. Authorities closed the crossing last week, and later cleared makeshift camps where thousands had gathered. But the ramification of the border crisis will continue to be felt in Europe and beyond, with uncertainty over what comes next.Here\\'s what you need to know about the crisis that\\'s unfolding on Europe\\'s frontier.Migrants are facing dire conditionsRead MoreCharities said people stuck in the border area have battled freezing weather and lacked food and medical attention, with reports of beatings and grueling conditions emerged. Polish police said Monday that around 3,500 people had gathered near the Kuznica crossing. On Friday, Belarusian border officials told CNN that 200 children and 600 women were among an estimated 2,000 people massed near the border crossing. Some of those are only babies or toddlers.One Syrian asylum-seeker, who recently arrived in Poland after his third attempt at crossing the border from Belarus, told CNN that on arriving at the border, guards caught him and three others in his group. He was beaten up, and suffered facial injuries, a broken nose and bruised ribs. Polish authorities said seven migrants have been found dead on Poland\\'s side of the border, with reports of more deaths in Belarus.Polish officers at the Polish-Belarusian border on November 8. The makeshift camps where migrants had been been staying on the Bruzgi-Ku탄nica crossing were finally cleared by Belarusian authorities on Thursday, with migrants moved to a nearby warehouse that has been converted into an ad hoc processing center.Although the shelter has offered a reprieve from below-zero temperatures and rough living conditions in the short term, Belarus has yet to lay out what comes next for migrants who flew to Minsk in the hope of making it to Europe, and a better life. Many now fear their new accommodation is just a first step in the deportation process.Since the beginning of November, there have been thousands of recorded border crossing attempts, according to Polish authorities. Belarus clears migrant camps at border as first repatriation flight leaves for IraqA spokesperson for Poland\\'s border guards told CNN on Monday that there had been \"forced mass attempts to cross the border\" in Kuznica area by a group of people over the weekend and that the situation was \"very tense and very dangerous.\" Last week, Polish border guard representatives told CNN that some of the migrants had been pushed toward the barriers by Belarusian services. Speaking on Monday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Belarus was doing everything to prevent people from accumulating at the border.Polish authorities have detained small numbers of people, allowing only small numbers of people the option of applying for asylum in Poland. Others have been immediately sent back to Belarus.Access to the border area has been tightly restricted. Journalists and aid workers have been blocked from traveling to the area by an exclusion zone.Poland\\'s government is ramping up its nationalist rhetoricPolish President Andrzej Duda visited the border last Thursday in a show of solidarity with the military, police and border guards. Earlier in the day, Duda addressed thousands of Poles who marched through Warsaw to celebrate Independence Day.In a speech with nationalistic references in support of the government\\'s strict policy of keeping the border with Belarus closed to migrants, he said: \"We have always been, we are and we will be part of a Europe based on Christian values, which are also the foundations of our tradition and culture.\"\"The time has come when you need to defend your homeland. But we need to guard its borders more than before,\" Duda said, adding: \"It must be done with dedication, with sleepless nights, in coldness, in hardship, in a very ungrateful situation to which we were forced by the hybrid actions of the Belarusian regime against Poland and against the European Union.\"Humanitarian groups are accusing Poland\\'s ruling party of violating the international right to asylum by pushing people back into Belarus instead of accepting their applications for protection. Under article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries. Poland says its actions are legal.A larger political crisis is brewingLukashenko has been accused of manufacturing the migrant crisis on the border by the prime ministers of neighboring Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, leading Poland to adopt a bill in October for the construction of a wall along its border with Belarus.NATO\\'s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also pointed the finger at Belarus, saying last week that \"Belarus using migrants as a hybrid tactic is unacceptable.\"Lukashenko\\'s government has repeatedly denied such claims, instead blaming the West for the crossings and treatment of migrants.Russia, Belarus\\' largest (and most important) political and economic partner, has defended Minsk\\'s handling of the issue and has denied any involvement in the crisis.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Russia had \"absolutely nothing to do with\" the crisis at the border.JUST WATCHEDRussia releases video of bombers flying over BelarusReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRussia releases video of bombers flying over Belarus 01:23Russia underlined its support for the Lukashenko regime by performing joint military exercises over Belarusian airspace last week.On Wednesday, two long-range Russian Tupolev Tu-22M3 supersonic long-range bombers practiced \"issues of interaction with ground control points\" with armed forces of both countries, the Russian Ministry of Defense said. On Thursday, they carried out those flights over Belarus\\' airspace for a second time.The two nations then held joint paratrooper drills near the Polish border on Friday.Meanwhile, Ukraine is also scaling up security around the border with Belarus. On Thursday, it announced it would hold military drills with some 8,500 servicemen and 15 helicopters in an area near its borders with Poland and Belarus to counter a potential migrant crisis.Speaking to \"Axios on HBO\" last week, Stoltenberg said the alliance was closely monitoring \"unusual\" Russian troop movements near the Ukraine border and would be ready to address what may happen.Following talks in Brussels with Ukraine\\'s foreign minister, Stoltenberg said on Monday: \"We again call on Russia to de-escalate, to reduce tensions and be transparent on their military activities in and around Ukraine.\" Stoltenberg has promised NATO\\'s \"support\" to Ukraine, which is not a NATO member.The crisis at the Poland-Belarus border is continuing to test a fragile political order, with allegations from the United States on Russia\\'s military buildup deepening concerns over the potential for a wider geopolitical crisis.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last Wednesday that the US was \"concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity\" and mentioned the possibility that Russia may be \"attempting to rehash\" its 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Last Friday, Russia said any allegations that it could invade Ukraine were \"empty, groundless escalation of tensions.\"Belarus faces new sanctionsBelarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, speaking to CNN in October. European leaders have accused Belarus of manufacturing the migrant crisis on the EU border as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses, a claim the Belarus government has repeatedly denied.In response to the escalation, the United States and the European Union announced new sanctions against Belarus last week. On Monday, the EU\\'s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was going to extend sanctions further.\"Today we are going to approve a new package of sanctions against Belarusian people responsible for what\\'s happening ... and we are going to launch a framework in order to implement other sanctions to other people, airlines, travel agencies and everybody involved on this illegal push of migrants in our borders,\" he said.The White House\\'s National Security Council said last week the US was preparing \"follow-up sanctions\" designed to hold Belarusian leaders accountable for \"ongoing attacks on democracy, human rights and international norms.\" The spokesperson did not specify when the new sanctions would come into place. \"We are deeply concerned by the Lukashenka regime\\'s inhumane actions and strongly condemn their callous exploitation and coercion of vulnerable people,\" the spokesperson said.This is the second round of sanctions announced by the US in recent months. In August, the White House announced a sweeping executive order targeting those in the Belarusian regime involved in the repression of human rights and democracy.The executive order was released on the one-year anniversary of Belarus\\' election, which sparked widespread protests throughout the country and which the US -- and much of the international community -- declared fraudulent.CNN\\'s Ivana Kottasov찼, Nadine Schmidt, Katharina Krebs, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Antonia Mortensen and Magda Chodownik and Anna Chernova contributed reporting.

              " ' (CNN)The 2021 season has been a pivotal one for Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield, both on and off the field.A No. 1 overall pick in 2018, he has helped transform the franchise from bottom-dwelling strugglers to playoff qualifiers through a combination of his toughness and leadership. However, he and the team have struggled maintaining consistency on the field, casting doubts about whether the team will opt to offer him a new long-term contract. However, away from the field Mayfield has also been displaying his leadership qualities. He has long spoken out in defense of Julius Jones, who had been convicted of the 1999 murder of Paul Howell during a carjacking. Jones has been on death row for nearly 20 years, but the 40-year-old, his family, attorneys and supporters say he is innocent.Read MoreLast season, Mayfield displayed Jones\\' name on the back of his helmet in solidarity for the inmate.Mayfield wears cleats calling for justice for Julius Jones before a game against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium on October 4, 2020.On Wednesday, the 26-year-old Mayfield -- among other members of the sporting world -- used his platform to call for the Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt to spare Jones.\"That\\'s not something that\\'s easy to talk about,\" an emotional Mayfield -- who played football at the University of Oklahoma -- told reporters. \"I\\'ve been trying to get the facts stated and the truth to be told for a while, but it is tough to think about. Tried and tried. It is a shame that it has gotten this far. We are 24 hours away. So, it\\'s tough. You know, hopefully, God can intervene, and handle it correctly and do the things he needs to do.\"A day later, Stitt granted clemency to Jones, commuting Jones\\' death sentence to life in prison without parole just hours before he was scheduled to be executed.Mayfield reacted to the news on Twitter: \"God is GREAT!!! Thank you to everybody that prayed and continued to pray!\"The quarterback\\'s support for Jones has won plaudits. \"Whatever you think of Baker Mayfield, he has been advocating for Julius Jones for quite awhile,\" tweeted former NFL star Stephen White. \"And definitely longer than I knew his story and I doubt I\\'m alone.\"Mayfield throws the ball during the  game against the New England Patriots. For the long run or a short-term fix? If Mayfield is beloved in Cleveland, the NFL quarterback\\'s future appears uncertain at the Browns.His charisma and dedication combined with his play on the field has endeared him to a dedicated fan base. Now in his fourth year with the team, he has thrown for 13,105 yards and 84 touchdowns since being drafted, helping to transform the historically snake-bitten Ohio team and helping to earn them their first post season playoff berth since 2002. The Browns exercised Mayfield\\'s fifth-year contract option for the 2022 season -- worth $18.9 million guaranteed -- though he has struggled with injuries and accuracy on the field this season. He has been playing through a torn labrum, something that NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported he will need surgery on at the end of the season. As a result, there are questions as to whether the team will choose to stick with Mayfield and offer him a long-term contract, like the Buffalo Bills did with Mayfield\\'s fellow 2018 Draft quarterback Josh Allen -- he signed a six-year contract extension worth up to $258 million with $150 million guaranteed in August. Cleveland and Mayfield\\'s agent didn\\'t immediately respond to CNN\\'s request for comment on the status of any potential future contract for the quarterback.Mayfield turns to hand the ball off during the game against the New England Patriots.Fox Sports analyst Jay Glazer thinks that the Browns will consider all their options at the end of the year, including Mayfield\\'s position as starting quarterback. \"It\\'s kind of a sticky situation right cause sometimes they look at him and they\\'re like: \\'OK we can win with this guy, he can be our guy,\\' but there will be a lot of veteran [quarterbacks] who will perhaps be up for grabs in the offseason,\" Glazer said on the \"Pat McAfee Show\" on Wednesday.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"When [The Browns] are looking at it and they see who\\'s available, what guys they can get in a trade, what guys they can get in the draft and they think Baker is the better option long-term then they got to go long-term with him.\"',\n",

              " ' (CNN)A 70-year-old man sustained a \"serious leg injury\" in southwestern France on Saturday after an encounter with a bear, according to a statement from the southwestern prefecture of Ari챔ge. The hunter, who had been pursuing wild boars, was assisted by the high mountain gendarmerie team and promptly taken to a local hospital \"in a worrying condition,\" the statement said. A spokesperson from the French Gendarmerie was unable to confirm to CNN whether the hunter shot the bear, though the statement from the prefecture of Ari챔ge read that gendarmes had \"located a bear carcass below the place where the victim was found, which could accredit the thesis of an accident linked to the encounter between the man and the animal.\"A judicial investigation has since unfolded to examine the circumstances of the accident. The largest carnivore in Europe, brown bears had nearly disappeared from France until the French government began a program to reintroduce them in the Pyrenees mountains in 1996. That year, French authorities started to import bears from Slovenia belonging to the same species as Pyrenean bears and release them in the southwestern mountain chain.Read MoreAccording to a report from the Brown Bear Network, part of the French Office for Biodiversity, there were 64 brown bears in the Pyrenees last year, all descendants of Slovenian bears reintroduced over the years.Their presence leads to increasing tensions with local farmers, because of the threat they pose to their livestock. The report shows Ari챔ge is the French department that has the highest number of bears, and where the most bear-related damage has been measured last year -- with 329 bear-related attacks in 2020.

              " ' (CNN)Russian rescue dog Monika has a new spring in her step after being fitted with titanium prosthetic legs -- just months after doctors suggested she should be put down because of severe injuries. The operation was conducted by vet Sergei Gorshkov, who is based in the city of Novosibirsk and has fitted 37 animals with prosthetic limbs since 2015 -- although Monika is the first dog to benefit from his work. Two weeks after her operation, the pooch is adjusting well to her new mobility -- and Gorshkov says she will soon be leading a normal life, although he was \"surprised\" by the speed of her recovery.Monika was initially found without her paws in December 2020 by workers in the village of Plastunovskaya.Veterinarian Sergei Gorshkov pets Monika at the clinic in Novosibirsk.\"I don\\'t think we were optimistic about that,\" he told CNN. \"But on the third day she started standing up and walking around the clinic, going from room to room.\"However, it wasn\\'t easy getting Monika into the operation room -- she was initially found without her paws in December 2020 by workers in the village of Plastunovskaya, and the volunteers who rescued her suspect she had been abused.Read MoreMonika was brought into the care of animal rescue volunteers Marina Gapich and Alla Leonkina, based in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where she had her damaged limbs amputated and received a blood transfusion. Gapich told CNN she and Leonkina had \"sleepless nights\" over Monika, and disagreed with veterinary advice to have her euthanized. The two women got in touch with Gorshkov and raised 400,000 Russian rubles (over $5,400) for the operation.Hello from your best friend -- the device that lets your dog call youMonika\\'s prosthetics then had to be printed by a 3D printer in the town of Troitstk, not far from Moscow and then biocoated at Tomsk Polytechnic University before Gorshkov carried out the procedure. For the vet, much of his work has taken on a new significance during the last 18 months, with the \"pandemic pet\" being especially important to some.\"I\\'m happy to give a new life to the animals since especially now during Covid,\" Gorshkov said. \"People find some consolation in animals and so by treating animals, I treat people.\"And Monika has already found her way into the hearts of the volunteers who rescued her. Asked whether the pooch would be staying in Novosibirsk, the answer from Gapich was a definite no.\"We are her carers, we are responsible for her!\" she told CNN, adding that she and Leonkina were in touch with a London-based animal behaviorist who might now be consulted on Monika\\'s case.

              " ' (CNN)\"From early on there was a lot of, \\'You lot sit over there near the toilets,\\' the word \\'P***\\' was used constantly, no one ever stamped it out,\" said former cricketer Azeem Rafiq as he laid bare this week his experience of racial abuse at one of England\\'s top clubs.  November 16, 2021 may come to be remembered as cricket\\'s day of reckoning; in the aftermath of Rafiq\\'s testimony, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) -- the sport\\'s regulator in those two countries -- spoke of taking the \"necessary action\" and the need to \"learn lessons as a game.\" The ECB has quite a job on its hands.Rafiq\\'s detailed account of his time at Yorkshire County Cricket Club hardly shocked Taj Butt, who worked for the Yorkshire Cricket Foundation, the club\\'s charity and community arm, between 2014 and 2017.\"As depressing as it was listening to him ... some of the things he faced didn\\'t come as a surprise to most people involved in the game, whether it\\'s at a grassroots level or at the highest level,\" Butt tells CNN Sport. Read More\"These are the sort of things that unfortunately do still happen on an everyday basis.\" During his testimony to UK lawmakers on Tuesday, Rafiq detailed some of the appalling behavior he was subjected to while playing for Yorkshire, adding that he believes he lost his cricket career to racism. In an interview with CNN, Rafiq also said he would stop his children from getting into cricket as he doesn\\'t want his \"son or daughter to be in pain.\" The hours-long testimony was the culmination of a 16-month period, during which Yorkshire undertook an independent review into more than 40 allegations of racism and bullying made by Rafiq.  Following the review, the club accepted that Rafiq had been the \"victim of inappropriate behavior\" at Yorkshire, although no one at the club was disciplined as a result of the independent investigation.   On Tuesday, former Yorkshire chairman Roger Hutton, who resigned from his role amid the handling of Rafiq\\'s allegations, said the club is institutionally racist. Hutton said that the ECB \"declined to help\" when he approached the governing body after learning of Rafiq\\'s allegations.For Butt, who has been involved in the sport in the Yorkshire area for much of his life, the lack of accountability in response to Rafiq\\'s allegations has been stark. \"The institution has been quite arrogant about the fact that they felt they could actually get away without having to do anything,\" he says. \"That\\'s actually shown in the way they\\'ve dealt with Azeem Rafiq and the whole situation. We certainly hope that the first thing they do is recognize that there is a problem.  \"That\\'s one thing they have never done, they\\'ve never seen it as a problem ... But I think they\\'re still at that denial stage.\" CNN has contacted Yorkshire for a response to Butt\\'s comments. Rafiq plays a shot against Middlesex in September 2016.On Thursday, Rafiq apologized for anti-Semitic comments he said he made in 2011 following the emergence of a screenshot of messages. \"I am incredibly angry at myself and I apologise to the Jewish community and everyone who is rightly offended by this,\" Rafiq said.In response to the apology, Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: \"Azeem Rafiq has suffered terribly at the hands of racists in cricket so he will well understand the hurt this exchange will cause to Jews who have supported him.  \"His apology certainly seems heartfelt and we have no reason to believe he is not completely sincere.\" Kamlesh Patel, who recently took over from Hutton as chair of Yorkshire, has vowed that the club will change. \"There is no quick fix to the clear problems which have been identified, and the issues are complex, not least the charge of institutional racism which must be addressed head on,\" he said in a statement. \"Azeem noted that this is not about individuals, but rather the structure and processes of the Club, and we need to tackle this.  \"It is clear that we have good people at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and that gives me hope that we can.\" JUST WATCHEDMonty Panesar on the Azeem Rafiq testimony to UK lawmakersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMonty Panesar on the Azeem Rafiq testimony to UK lawmakers 04:57\\'Glass ceiling\\'  While Rafiq\\'s testimony has made headlines this week, Butt says the Yorkshire region has been mistreating South Asian cricketers for decades, even at a grassroots level.  He currently serves as chair of the Quaid-e-Azam Sunday Cricket League (QeASCL), which was formed in 1980 in an attempt to create more opportunities for Asian cricketers in Yorkshire and its surrounding areas. \"For a young Asian person to go and join the local club, that was simply a no-go area for them,\" Butt explains of the reasons behind the league\\'s formation.  He adds: \"In the sport of cricket, there is a great divide if you happen to be from the South Asian community and from an inner-city area and don\\'t go to a [fee-paying] public school. \"You are going to face a great disadvantage in participation in the sport of cricket because your access to facilities, grounds and all the other things that go on to make things more accessible unfortunately is lacking.\" Over the years, a handful of players who starred for teams in the QeASCL have gone on to play professional cricket, including Yorkshire and England\\'s Adil Rashid. Yorkshire is home to a large South Asian population, but the county side only lifted its rule of selecting Yorkshire-born players in 1992.\"We\\'ve always known for our young people to progress, they\\'re going to have to be twice as good as their White counterparts in order to develop further,\" says Butt. \"Clearly, once they get into the system and the higher up they go ... there seem to be barriers, there still seems to be that glass ceiling. And clearly, young people are still being discriminated against.\" Yorkshire County Cricket Club has promised to address racism problems within the organization.Pathway restrictions are not just unique to Yorkshire. According to the ECB, South Asian communities account for 30% of all cricket players in England and Wales, but just 4% of first class county cricketers are of South Asian origin.  The ECB operates a South Asian Action Plan to create more opportunities for -- and to better engage with -- South Asian communities. \\'Significant moment for change\\' The week before Rafiq\\'s testimony in UK Parliament, during which he described cricket\\'s racism problem as \"worse than society,\" those with experience of discrimination in the sport have been urged to submit their perceptions and experiences to the Independent Commission for Equity on Cricket (ICEC). Cindy Butts, chair of the ICEC, told the BBC that more than 1,000 people came forward to share their experiences in the week after the call for evidence was made. \"In years to come, we will see this as a significant moment for change in cricket and society,\" former England cricketer Monty Panesar told CNN this week. \"Azeem Rafiq should be applauded for his brave comments. He\\'s willing to work with the ECB and Yorkshire County Cricket Club to address some of the issues in our game.\" ',\n",
              " \" (CNN)With the 2020 editions of the biggest football matches in South America postponed and played in front of a handful of fans due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this year's upcoming tournament finals are promising a different look by bringing supporters back in the stands.The championship matches of two men's and one women's tournaments -- the Copa Sudamericana, Copa Libertadores Femenina and Copa Libertadores -- are being played over the course of two weekends starting Saturday in Montevideo, Uruguay. Organized by continental governing body CONMEBOL, the finals will take place in front of capacity crowds for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The government of Uruguay established requirements to attend, including proof of vaccination for those over the age of 12 and face masks to be worn for the duration of the events.Traveling to Uruguay during Covid-19: What you need to know before you goThe country this month also reopened its borders to travelers with stipulations. Visitors to Uruguay over the age of 18 are required to have completed vaccination, and a negative PCR test within 72 hours of arrival is required for those over the age of 6. Read MoreCovid-19 cases in Uruguay have significantly leveled off from a surge earlier this year, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. More than 75% of the population is fully vaccinated. Five of the six clubs participating are from neighboring Brazil, leaving many to hope the newly opened borders and expanded stadium access will help a battered tourism industry.With spectators turning to the action on the pitch, here's what to know about some of the top sporting events in South America. Aerial view of the Centenario Stadium in Montevideo, which will host the finals of the men's Sudamericana and Libertadores cups on November 20 and 27 respectively.Copa SudamericanaThe first of the three finals in Uruguay kicks off with the Copa Sudamericana, South America's secondary men's club tournament, which is on a par with UEFA's Europa League. Two Brazilian clubs survived the group stages and knockout rounds to make the final, as Club Athletico Paranaense squares off against Red Bull Bragantino. Both sides finished mid-table last season in Brazil's S챕rie A. The clubs have strikingly different histories, with one a regular fixture in Brazilian top-flight while the other is a newcomer to the scene. Athletico are recent Copa Sudamericana champions, winning it all in 2018. Since the turn of the century, the club has competed in S챕rie A in all but one season and won the league in 2001. Red Bull Bragantino was once known as Clube Atl챕tico Bragantino, finishing as high as second in Brazilian football in 1991 before relegation and a long stretch of competing in second and third divisions. The club was taken over by energy drink empire Red Bull two years ago and rebranded, coinciding with promotion back to S챕rie A for the first time in more than 20 seasons.  The match will be played at Estadio Centenario, the home of Uruguay's national team and a host stadium of the inaugural World Cup in 1930. Kickoff is Saturday 5 p.m. local time (8 p.m. GMT).A worker displays the Copa Libertadores (L) and Copa Sudamericana trophies in Luque, Paraguay, on April 9, 2021. Copa Libertadores FemeninaThe final of the Copa Libertadores Femenina, the continental tournament for women's football, will see Brazil's Corinthians face off against Colombian side Independiente Santa Fe. Both clubs are aligned with their well-known men's football counterparts of the same names. Corinthians is searching for its third South American championship since 2017; they won their first as part of a combined squad with club Audax, then won again in 2019 as a solo effort. Santa Fe is making its second consecutive appearance in the tournament and succeeded for the first time this year in escaping the group stage. Should they win, Santa Fe will have defeated all three Brazilian teams in the tournament during the knockout rounds to claim victory.Paraguay hosted the semifinals, with the final set for Sunday at another of Uruguay's former World Cup venues, the Estadio Gran Parque Central. Copa LibertadoresOne of the most highly regarded club tournaments in the world, the Copa Libertadores is the continental equivalent of the UEFA Champions League. And like the Copa Sudamericana, two teams from Brazil have advanced to the final. In front of tens of thousands of fans at Estadio Centenario on Saturday, November 27, Brazilian titans Palmeiras and Flamengo will battle to determine who can win their second Copa Libertadores in less than three years. Palmeiras fans gather to celebrate dramatic Copa Libertadores winPalmeiras, located in S찾o Paulo, are the tournament's defending champions, defeating Santos in January in front of a small crowd due to pandemic restrictions. Victory would make Palmeiras the first side to win back-to-back trophies since 2001. Flamengo, located in Rio de Janeiro, have also performed well on the big stage as of late, having won the Copa Libertadores in 2019 and are the defending champions of S챕rie A.Both teams are currently in the top three in the S챕rie A standings, chasing Clube Atl챕tico Mineiro with a handful of matches remaining. The final itself has been moved or postponed multiple times in recent years.  In 2018, the second leg of a home-and-away Copa Libertadores final between Argentinian rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate was suspended due to fan unrest, with the Boca team bus attacked and players injured after being hit by projectiles en route to the stadium. The match was later played in Madrid, Spain.   In 2019 -- won by Flamengo -- the final was moved from Chile to Peru due to civil unrest and national protests over inequality and corruption.The winners of the Copa Libertadores will progress to the FIFA Club World Cup, which will be held in the United Arab Emirates in early 2022.The Club World Cup pits continental champions against each another in a knockout tournament.

The protests were organized after the Netherlands reimposed some lockdown measures last weekend for an initial three weeks, in an effort to slow a wave of coronavirus cases.

              " ' (CNN)The chaos at the border between Poland and Belarus is just the latest incident to get top brass in Brussels pondering what the European Union should do long-term about its internal security. This migrant crisis, in which Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko stands accused of directing refugees to the Polish border, took place as fears ramped up in eastern Europe over a build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine\\'s border. Recent geopolitical crises, most notably the messy withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, has cemented thinking that the EU cannot rely entirely on the United States or NATO for its protection.Coincidentally, the initial blueprint for such a plan was presented to EU member states this week. The \"Strategic Compass for Security and Defence\" is a loose outline of how cooperation across the bloc might work. The document was leaked to CNN in full. A picture taken on November 8, 2021 shows migrants at the Belarusian-Polish border in the Grodno region.The main proposal is that the EU obtains the capacity to rapidly deploy up to 5,000 troops to deal with numerous potential crises. Rather than a permanent force reporting to a commander in Brussels, these rapid deployment groups will be a collection of troops from across the participating member states, formed to tackle a specific task and commanded from an EU level on that mission. Those tasks could range from an evacuation mission, such as in Afghanistan, to peacekeeping on a border or humanitarian missions. Read MoreThe document also talks about the need for a joined-up approach in defense procurement, research and intelligence, making the bloc more competitive and efficient. It acknowledges that to do this, national and EU spending would have to increase and focus on filling in the gaps that currently exist across the EU as a whole. Not all 27 EU countries would be required to participate; however, deploying troops in the name of the EU would require signoff and involvement of member states, and the details of how this would work are yet to be confirmed.While Euroskeptic derision at the idea of an \"EU Army\" means this latest proposal is a far cry from the 1999 goal of up to 60,000 troops ready to deploy at any given moment, it\\'s still ambitious and, unusually for a top down, multilateral EU proposal, is broadly supported by all 27 member states. However, these are early days and reaching agreement on anything costly from 27 countries who face vastly different security and fiscal concerns will be far from straightforward. Polish servicemen are seen on the other side of barbed wire during clashes between migrants and Polish border guards at the Belarus-Poland border near Grodno, Belarus, on Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2021.To get an idea of where heads are at this early stage, CNN spoke with more than 20 EU officials, diplomats and politicians from across the bloc with the aim of answering a question many have asked for years: Will the EU ever have an army to call its own?The broad picture is that everyone agrees on the central point: Something must be done if Europe is to be kept safe. Pietro Benassi, Italy\\'s ambassador to the EU, told CNN that while the Compass must be agreed by 27 nations -- some that are \"constitutionally neutral, [and] others that have diverse constitutional and military postures\" -- he is confident that the EU can \"build a common strategic culture\" and that the plan will provide momentum to that end. This opinion, or some version of it, was shared by almost everyone that CNN spoke with. However, long-standing divisions exist that will inevitably slow that momentum. The keenest country is without question France. President Emmanuel Macron has made no secret of his dream for a stronger Europe with greater integration on foreign affairs. He has even called for a \"real European army\" to reduce Europe\\'s need for US-led NATO protection. The current aim is that the Strategic Compass gets agreed in March, while France holds the EU\\'s rotating presidency. But Macron might want to stick the champagne on ice, as many of his European counterparts are less gung-ho when it comes to defense. Most notably, some in the eastern EU -- countries like Poland, Estonia and Lithuania -- are in favor of the plan, but only if a formal agreement makes specific reference to the threat that Russia, and to a lesser extent China, pose. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a signing ceremony in Beijing\\'s Great Hall of the People on June 25, 2016 in Beijing, China. At present, the document does address the EU\\'s deteriorating relationship with its neighbor, but also says \"common interests and a shared culture in fact link the EU and Russia,\" and that it would still engage with \"Russia in some specific issues on which we have shared priorities.\" Eastern states have also expressed concern about any plan that would undermine NATO. Similarly worried about Russia are the Scandinavians. Diplomats and officials from these countries explained that \"we are at real risk from Russia in this part of the world\" and made clear that the \"transatlantic alliance needs to be strengthened as part of any broader EU plan.\" Multiple officials, diplomats and politicians said they believed that Macron was the main sticking point, reluctant to point the finger at Russia. Next, the so-called \"frugals.\" This is not the exact same \"Frugal Four\" -- Denmark, which has an opt-out on the Strategic Compass, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden -- that made life difficult for the EU when it signed off its Covid package last year. However, officials from some of these countries expressed concern that troops assigned to rapid deployment teams would never be used, that action would be vetoed and the whole thing would end up a waste of money that undermined the NATO and undercut the transatlantic alliance. The final piece of the puzzle is Germany. The EU\\'s richest country is still negotiating its next coalition government and officials say it is very hard to predict exactly how hawkish Berlin will be in the coming year. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) and then Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyenat the Bundestag on Germany\\'s participation in a coalition-led military intervention in Syria on December 4, 2015. Von der Leyen is now the EU Commission President. One German diplomat told CNN: \"We still don\\'t know who will run defense. It seems likely it will be the socialists, who will be willing to give small contributions on things like field hospitals and not engaging overseas like France, I think, might want us to. It could be a real disagreement.\" Despite all the potential pitfalls, there is sincere optimism that these differences can be bridged if everyone gets realistic and serious. Rasa Juknevi훾ien휊, a member of the European Parliament and Lithuania\\'s former defense minister, says that \"only the EU is able to solve\" the hybrid threats it faces from hostile actors in Russia and China. However, she expresses concern that if the bloc cannot agree on issues ranging from cyber security, military capability, a more \"realistic view of Russia\" and, above all, spending, then \"it will just be like Greta Thunberg says, just blah blah blah.\" Former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb believes that Brussels\\' renewed enthusiasm for security is \"timely, important and realistic. The US is not going to back up European security forever.\" He says that if Europe is to get serious about protecting itself \"it needs to understand that the line between war and peace is blurred ... soft power has been weaponized and become hard power. We see that with asylum-seekers being used as weapons. We see with information, trade, energy and vaccines being used as weapons.\"President Macron is the loudest cheerleader for an integrated EU foreign policy The EU has largely been applauded for the sincere scope of its ambition, and analysts hope they can reach a meaningful agreement on one of the trickiest issues in European diplomacy. Velina Tchakarova, director of the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy, acknowledges that finding consensus will be a long process but can see positive movement. \"Once it is approved ... there will be concrete directions in which the EU and the member states should go when it comes to forging partnerships and alliances, enhancing capabilities, creating resilience in key domains and sectors, and finally achieving rapid and efficient crisis management based on shared strategic assessment of common threats.\" It would be an extraordinary achievement. While not the EU Army that many either longed for or feared -- depending on your perspective -- it is refreshing to see the member states so broadly on the same page on an issue that clearly needs addressing. However, this really is the start of the process and there is a lot of politics to get through -- including next year\\'s French election that could hurl Macron, the chief cheerleader, from office. And politics is so often what ruins Brussels\\' best-laid plans. Steven Blockmans, director of research at the Center for European Policy Studies, says that \"for the rubber to hit the road, member states will have to set aside their domestic concerns of blood and treasure and let common security interests prevail. Any single member state could therefore delay or veto deployment for so-called \\'vital\\' national security concerns.\"For all the positive sounds now, it is entirely possible that once all 27 leaders get locked in a room to discuss this proposal, naked national interest and previous gripes take over and this plan gets watered down or shelved. And while the top brass in Brussels remains optimistic that this plan is enough of a compromise to avoid such petulance, when there\\'s this much money on the table and political capital at stake, diplomacy, compromise, and unity can easily go out the window. Which, for the EU, would hardly be the first time.',\n",

He is expected to wear his Pride helmet for the actual competition in the Qatar Grand Prix, which will take place on November 21.For Vecchietti, this is monumental in terms of representation for the intersex community.\"I wished and hoped for this sort of visibility, as you always do,\" she said. \"But I had no idea that somebody as huge as Lewis Hamilton would make this fantastic statement of solidarity.\"',\n",

              " 'Bruzgi-Ku탄nica border region, Belarus (CNN)Makeshift migrant camps at a checkpoint on the Belarus-Poland border, where thousands had amassed in recent weeks, were cleared by Belarusian authorities on Thursday, ending a months-long standoff that has ratcheted up tensions in the region.The move comes just two days after a dramatic flare-up in violence between migrants, who tried to breach the razor-wire border fence. Polish officers responded with a volley of water cannons and tear gas.Belarusian border guards have moved all remaining migrants from the Bruzgi-Ku탄nica crossing to a nearby warehouse, which has been converted into an ad hoc processing center. And though the shelter has offered a reprieve from below-zero temperatures and rough living conditions in the short term, Belarus has yet to lay out what comes next for migrants who flew to Minsk in the hope of making it to Europe, and a better life. Many now fear their new accommodation is just a first step in the deportation process. Heshw Muhammad, a 27-year-old from Iraqi Kurdistan, told CNN on Wednesday she was terrified that she and her family would be deported by Belarusian authorities to Iraqi Kurdistan, where she says they have nothing left. She had been camped out on the border for two weeks in the freezing cold with her husband and their young daughters, aged 2, 4 and 7 years old.Read More\"Before my children die, we need help. I have [a] message, we want ... to go to Germany,\" she said.Migrants, including children, shout across the razor wire fence at the Bruzgi-Kuznica border crossing on Wednesday.On Thursday, the Iraqi government began to repatriate citizens who requested to leave. More than 400 Iraqi citizens who were transferred from Belarus\\' border to the capital Minsk were evacuated on an Iraqi Airways on Thursday, the Iraqi Transportation Ministry said in a statement. Seven thousand migrants -- mostly from the Middle East -- are still in Belarus, including about 2,000 at the border near Bruzgi, according to Belarus\\' government.While some have agreed to go home, most still insist on being allowed to continue their journey west, primarily to Germany, a spokeswoman for Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said on Thursday, adding that they would not be pushed to their home countries unwillingly.\"We will not be forcefully pushing anyone to Iraq, Syria, or other countries,\" Natalya Eismont said, according to the state news agency BelTA.Tensions mount in EuropeThe EU has blamed Belarus for manufacturing the crisis on the bloc\\'s eastern border, alleging that the government has opened the flood gates to people desperate to flee a region beleaguered by unemployment and instability. EU officials have called it a \"hybrid war,\" which they say is designed to punish Poland for taking in the president\\'s political opponents and pressure the bloc into lifting sanctions on Belarus.  But speaking to CNN on Thursday, Belarus\\' foreign minister Vladimir Makei rejected those accusations, saying they were a \"false assessment of the situation.\"Violence erupts on Poland-Belarus border as Polish guards fire water cannon on migrants throwing rocks  \"This is a dramatic situation. We know that there are more than 600 women, more than 200 children, and to see how they suffer, it\\'s very difficult for a normal human being. We are not interested in having this situation here in Belarus,\" he said.Makei laid the crisis at the EU\\'s feet, saying the migrants had heard about the \"privileges\" neighboring EU countries had offered \"migrants from Belarus\" and believed that country was a \"comfortable route\" for them to get into the EU.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday criticized Poland, accusing the government of using the migrant crisis to stir up new tensions in the region. The deteriorating conditions on Europe\\'s doorstep underline the grim human toll of the geopolitical deadlock playing out between Belarus, an ally of Russia, and Poland, a member of the EU bloc and NATO. Neither side has been willing to back down, leaving migrants stuck in the middle.At least nine people have died on the border in recent weeks, many from hypothermia, according to the Polish border guard agency. Why chaos in eastern Europe is never bad news for Vladimir PutinAhmed al-Hassan, a 19-year-old Syrian man who drowned in a river last month while trying to cross from Belarus, was buried in a small town in northeast Poland on Tuesday. His grieving family in Syria watched the torchlit funeral service via video link.Thousands of migrants like al-Hassan -- mostly from the Middle East and Asia -- began appearing on the Belarusian side of the border over the summer, walking by foot through forests, rivers and swamps, to reach Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, on their quest for a better life in Europe. Few have made it.And even for those who have crossed into Poland, it\\'s uncertain whether they\\'ll be allowed to stay.Poland is under fire by international aid organizations who say they are violating international law by pushing asylum-seekers back into Belarus, instead of accepting their applications for international protection. Poland stands by its actions, saying they are legal.Tensions are rising on the Poland-Belarus border. Here\\'s what you need to knowAuthorities on the other side of the border in Belarus told CNN on Wednesday they were waiting to hear from officials in Munich about a possible \"humanitarian corridor\" to ferry migrants into the country. President Lukashenko on Monday offered to fly them to the German capital on its state-run airline if Poland refused to open its border. But that option looks incredibly unlikely. German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass said Monday evening Germany would not take in the migrants, and that the European Union\\'s plan was for them to go back home.In their second phone call in almost as many days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with Lukashenko on Wednesday to underline the need to ensure humanitarian care and return opportunities for the people affected, with the support of the UN and in cooperation with the EU Commission.Earlier on Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the commission would be mobilizing ??00,000 (about $791,000) to deliver food, blankets, hygiene and first aid kits to refugees at the Belarusian border. \"We are ready to do more. But the Belarusian regime must stop luring people and putting their lives at risk,\" von der Leyen said.Europe said Monday it would slap new sanctions on Belarus targeting \"everyone involved\" in exacerbating the border crisis. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell announced at a press conference in Brussels that the sanctions on \"people, airlines, travel agencies and everyone involved in this illegal push of migrants against our borders\" would be confirmed in the coming days.It will be the fifth round of sanctions on Belarus by the EU following a disputed presidential election and crackdown on dissidents.Smoke rises over a makeshift migrant camp on the Belarusian side of the border near Bruzgi.Lukashenko\\'s government has repeatedly denied such claims, instead blaming the West for the crossings and accusing it of poor treatment of migrants.Minsk allowed CNN and other international media outlets to visit the border and report on the scenes of migrants camped out there. Many have been staying in flimsy tents, with temperatures dropping well below freezing at night. Warsaw, meanwhile, has tried to keep the crisis from view, blocking the Polish side of the border to journalists, aid workers and doctors amid an extended state of emergency.\\'We have food, we have [a] bed\\'On Wednesday, CNN spoke with families who had sought shelter in the warehouse about a kilometer from the border, which normally houses cargo. Sprawled out on blankets and sleeping bags, their belongings heaped in piles around them, they were relieved to get out of the cold but worried about their future and bruised by the ordeal, which has seen some spend thousands on Belarusian visas and flights to Minsk.Many of the migrants say they traveled to Belarus in search of employment opportunities, medical care for family members, and a more stable life in Europe. Twenty-eight-year-old mother Shoxan Bapir Hussain, her husband and four-year-old son, Azhi Ali Xder, were among them. CNN first met the family a few days before in the freezing border camp. Hussain said the warehouse was better, warmer. \"We have food, we have [a] bed,\" she said.Hussain\\'s family embarked on the journey from Iraqi Kurdistan because of her son, whom she said needs surgery for a back condition. Azhi, who has splints on his legs, can\\'t walk. It\\'s those hopes and dreams that have kept people here in spite of the conditions.\"I wish to go to Germany ... I think Germany has humanity,\" Hussain said.Matthew Chance and Zahra Ullah reported from Belarus, while Antonia Mortensen reported from Poland. Eliza Mackintosh wrote and reported from London.

              " 'Hong Kong (CNN)The head of the Women\\'s Tennis Association has cast doubt on an email claiming to be from Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai, saying it only raises further concerns for her safety. China\\'s state-owned television broadcaster CGTN released the email, purportedly from Peng, in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time, amid growing international concern for her whereabouts. One of China\\'s most recognizable tennis stars, Peng has not been seen in public since she accused former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex at his home three years ago, according to screenshots of a since-deleted social media post dated November 2. Her post on Weibo, China\\'s Twitter-like platform, was deleted within 30 minutes of publication, with Chinese censors moving swiftly to wipe out any mention of the accusation online. Her Weibo account, which has more than half a million followers, is still blocked from searchers on the platform. Chinese tennis star accuses former top Communist Party leader of sexual assault, triggering blanket censorshipThe email -- which has not been verified by CNN -- claimed Peng is fine and appears to walk back her sexual allegations. It was sent to the WTA Chairman and CEO Steve Simon, CGTN reported.Read MoreSimon has said he doubts the email is authentic.\"The statement released today by Chinese state media concerning Peng Shuai only raises my concerns as to her safety and whereabouts,\" Simon said in a statement. \"I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her.\"He added: \"Peng Shuai must be allowed to speak freely, without coercion or intimidation from any source. Her allegation of sexual assault must be respected, investigated with full transparency and without censorship.\" The alleged email was released by CGTN only in English and domestic Chinese media have not reported on its contents, despite Peng being a household name in China. On Thursday, a video showed a TV in China tuned into CNN International\\'s programming which then transitions into bars, due to CNNi\\'s signal being censored in China to prevent further reporting on Peng\\'s accusations.Sports stars speak outFollowing the decision by the WTA to issue a statement demanding China respond to Peng\\'s allegations Sunday, a growing number of prominent athletes have spoken out on the issue. \"Censorship is never OK at any cost, I hope Peng Shuai and her family are safe and OK. I\\'m in shock of the current situation and I\\'m sending love and light her way,\"  tennis superstar Naomi Osaka said as part of a Twitter statement on Tuesday, alongside the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai.Tennis legend and 39 time Grand Slam championship-winner Billie Jean King said on Twitter, \"Hoping that Peng Shuai is found safe and that her accusations are fully investigated.\"And former world No.1 Chris Evert said, \"these accusations are very disturbing.\"\"I\\'ve known Peng since she was 14; we should all be concerned; this is serious; where is she? Is she safe? Any information would be appreciated,\" she said in a post on Twitter. Tennis\\' popularity in China has grown rapidly over the past few decades, with several Chinese players breaking into the global rankings. The women\\'s game, in particular, is a big market, thanks in part to the success of Chinese tennis star Li Na, who in 2011 became Asia\\'s first grand slam singles tennis champion when she won the French Open, followed by a second major title at the 2014 Australian Open.In recent years, the WTA has made a big push into China. In 2019, China hosted several WTA tournaments, including the WTA Finals held in Shenzhen for the first time that year. The event is set to return to the Chinese city from 2022 and be held there every year until 2030, according to the WTA.The direct and highly public intervention of the WTA is unusual for an international sporting body. Perceived criticisms of China, which is also due to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, have previously resulted in significant public and political backlash, as well as loss of access. In 2019, the National Basketball Association (NBA) became caught between free speech and the lucrative Chinese market when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. The response from China was severe, with the NBA\\'s Chinese partners suspending ties, state broadcaster CCTV halting all broadcasts of preseason matches.Last month, NBA faced a similar firestorm with Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter\\'s social media posts bringing awareness to China\\'s treatment of the Uyghur community, Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Amnesty International also called on China to prove Peng is safe and to investigate the sexual assault allegations, saying the country has \"systematically silenced the country\\'s #MeToo movement.\" \"Peng\\'s recent so-called statement that \\'everything is fine\\' should not be taken at face value as China\\'s state media has a track record of forcing statements out of individuals under duress, or else simply fabricating them. These concerns will not go away unless Peng\\'s safety and whereabouts are confirmed,\" Amnesty International\\'s China Researcher, Doriane Lau, said.\"While it is currently difficult to speculate on the reasons behind Peng Shuai\\'s apparent disappearance, what is clear is that her allegations of sexual violence by a senior politician must be properly investigated by the Chinese authorities.\"Peng Shuai\\'s case highlights the treatment faced by women survivors of sexual abuse in China, whose allegations are routinely ignored and who are often targeted for speaking out.\"Politically sensitive scandal Peng\\'s explosive #MeToo allegations against former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli have continued to reverberate across China, despite authorities\\' attempts to to wipe out any mention of such a politically sensitive scandal.Zhang, 75, served on the ruling Communist Party\\'s seven person Politiburo Standing Committee -- the country\\'s supreme leadership body -- from 2012 to 2017 during Chinese leader Xi Jinping\\'s first term in power. He retired as vice premier in 2018. In her post, which reads as an open letter to Zhang, the 35-year-old tennis star alleges a relationship over an intermittent period that spanned at least 10 years. \"Why did you have to come back to me, took me to your home to force me to have sex with you?\" she wrote.Peng said she did not have evidence to prove her allegations, and claimed Zhang was always worried that she would record things.\"I couldn\\'t describe how disgusted I was, and how many times I asked myself am I still a human? I feel like a walking corpse,\" wrote Peng.CNN cannot independently verify Peng\\'s post, and has reached out to both her and China\\'s State Council, which handles press inquires for the central government, for comment.Jennifer Hsu, a research fellow in the diplomacy and public opinion program at the Lowy Institute, said Beijing is \"acutely aware\" of the negative light Peng\\'s accusations cast on the Chinese Communist Party. She said it was \"possible the email was shared to an international audience to ward off further international scrutiny of the party-state.\"\"People who accuse current government officials or former officials in China can expect consequences,\" Hsu said. \"The public accusation against the former vice premiere may perhaps prompt other women to bring allegations of sexual misconduct by Communist Party members to the public and this something the party wishes to prevent. And thus, the \\'disappearance\\' of Peng Shuai is perhaps a strategy used to deter other accusers from coming forward.\"On Wednesday, China evaded questions from the media about Peng\\'s allegations against Zhang. Chinese MOFA spokesperson Zhao Lijian suggested reporters should reach out to the \"competent department,\" despite reporters remarking on the lack of response from the Ministry of Public Security.Speaking at a press conference, Zhao was asked about the WTA\\'s concerns over Peng\\'s \"safety and whereabouts\" and if the government planned on taking any action, to which Zhao said the issue \"wasn\\'t a diplomatic matter,\" declining to comment any further.When asked again on Thursday about Peng\\'s whereabouts, Zhao repeated that her sexual assault accusation is not a diplomatic issue and declined to comment further.

              " ' (CNN)A British F-35, one of the newest stealth fighter jets in the UK military, crashed into the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday morning while operating off the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, the UK Defense Ministry said in a tweet.The pilot ejected and was returned safely to the ship, and an investigation of the incident, which occurred during routine flight operations, had begun, the ministry said.Britain operates the F-35B, a single-engine, short-take-off vertical landing variant of the US-developed stealth jet, which cost about $115 million each to build.US warplanes fly first combat missions off foreign aircraft carrier since World War IIIn June, F-35s operating off the Queen Elizabeth flew combat missions over the Middle East against ISIS, the first combat action for a UK aircraft carrier in more than a decade.\"The ability to operate from the sea with the most advanced fighter jets ever created is a significant moment in our history, offering reassurance to our allies and demonstrating the UK\\'s formidable air power to our adversaries,\" British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in a statement at the time.Read MoreBritish F-35s saw their first combat in 2019, flying strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria from a Royal Air Force base on the island of Cyprus.With plans to acquire 138 F-35s, Britain would be the third-largest operator of the Lockheed-Martin produced jets, behind the United States and Japan.Both the US and Japan have lost F-35s to accidents.In September 2018, a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed in South Carolina, the first-ever crash of an F-35.In April 2019, a Japanese F-35A crashed into the Pacific Ocean off northern Japan, killing its pilot. The Japanese Defense Ministry later attributed that crash to spatial disorientation, meaning the pilot couldn\\'t sense his surroundings adequately and essentially flew the stealth fighter straight into the ocean during the night training mission.In May 2020, a US Air Force F-35A crashed in Florida during routine training, but the pilot ejected safely.After the crash Wednesday, the manufacturer of the F-35\\'s ejection seat, British company Martin-Baker, touted its hardware. \"We\\'ve saved 7,662 air crew lives from around the world to date,\" the company said on its Twitter page. Martin-Baker\\'s ejection seats are used on a range of aircraft, not just F-35s.The British crash comes on the last leg of a voyage for Queen Elizabeth, leading what the UK calls Carrier Strike Group 21, that saw it go as far as Japan and South Korea to participate in exercises with allies and partners as the Royal Navy tries to increase its global presence.UK\\'s HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier pictured in South China SeaWhen the strike group departed the UK in the spring, Britain\\'s Ministry of Defense described it as the largest concentration of maritime and air power to leave British shores in a generation.US and Dutch warships are part of the strike group, and 10 US Marine Corps F-35s have been operating off the Queen Elizabeth along with eight British stealth jets.When a version of this carrier strike group sailed together during military exercises off Scotland last fall, the UK Defense Ministry said it carried \"the largest concentration of fighter jets to operate at sea from a Royal Navy carrier since HMS Hermes in 1983.\"It also said it was \"the largest air group of fifth-generation fighters at sea anywhere in the world.\" Fifth-generation fighters are the most advanced warplanes in the air.There was no immediate word on whether the UK would try to recover the wreckage of the F-35 from the Mediterranean.When the Japanese F-35 crashed in 2019, there was speculation the wreckage could be a target for potential adversaries such as Russia and China who could gain access to its advanced technology.

              " 'Berlin (CNN)Germany reported its highest single day surge of Covid-19 infections as Chancellor Angela Merkel said the \"dramatic\" situation was the result of the fourth wave \"hitting our country with full force.\"The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany\\'s disease and control center, has reported 65,371 new cases within the last 24 hours -- it is an increase of 12,545 new infections compared to the previous 24-hour period.But these figures are likely to be under reported, and true scale of infections could be \"twice or three times as many,\" RKI chief Lothar Wieler told an online discussion with Saxony\\'s state premier Michael Kretschmer on Wednesday evening. The country reported 264 Covid-19 related deaths from Wednesday to Thursday, pushing the total number of deaths since the pandemic began to 98,000 people in Germany, according to RKI data. Germany\\'s seven-day incidence rate also hit record levels of 336.9 cases per 100,000 people, up from 249.1 cases reported a week ago, RKI reported. Read MoreThe definition of \\'fully vaccinated\\' is changing Germany has one of the lowest vaccination rates in western Europe, with just over 67% of the population fully vaccinated. Around 33% have no protection against the virus, according to the RKI.This is one of the reasons why infections have soared to record levels, say experts, aided by waning immunity of the Covid-19 vaccines and the more infectious Delta variant. \"As the vaccination campaign started in Germany at the beginning of this year, we now see some age groups and some people lose their immunity against Covid-19 quickly,\\'\\' Tobias Kurth, a professor of public health and epidemiology at the Charit챕 university hospital in Berlin, told CNN.\\'\\'The current pandemic situation in Germany is dramatic, I can\\'t say it any other way,\" outgoing Chancellor Merkel told mayors from across Germany on Wednesday.Hospitalizations and deaths remain at a much lower level than in previous peaks, but there is growing concern about gaps in the country\\'s vaccination coverage as it moves into the winter months.\\'\\'It would be a disaster to act only when the intensive care units are full, because then it would be too late,\\'\\' she added. \\'Lockdown for the unvaccinated\\'The situation means Germany is on track to become the next country to impose stricter rules on those who haven\\'t been fully inoculated. Three parties making up the country\\'s prospective new coalition government approved a draft law on Thursday that would see stricter rules come into effect. The measures -- which will be debated in the upper house of parliament on Friday -- would require Germans to wear face masks and provide proof of vaccination, a certificate of recovery, or a negative Covid-19 test in order to ride a bus or board a train, in an expansion of the country\\'s \"3G\" system that required a negative Covid-19 test to enter certain venues and settings. Free Covid-19 tests would be reintroduced as well as permission to work from home whenever possible.The new legislation is designed to provide a nationwide framework in which the country\\'s regions can choose from a toolbox of other measures, depending on the severity of the outbreak. To that end, regions have room to tighten curbs in Covid-19 hotspots as needed.Green Party co-leader Robert Habeck told public broadcaster ARD on Sunday that the rules in effect amount to a \"lockdown for the unvaccinated.\"Merkel will also debate the implementation of stricter Covid-19 curbs with Germany\\'s leaders of the 16 federal states. A country-wide lockdown might be the only option at this stage in Germany\\'s fourth wave, Kurth told CNN, as \"we simply have too many Covid-19 infections every day.\"\"Even if people are vaccinated, they can transmit the virus to others and we will continue to see a surge in cases. Unfortunately, we may need to think about going a step further and put in curbs for potentially the entire population,\\'\\' he added.Berlin has already imposed restrictions on unvaccinated people, where as of Monday proof of full vaccination or recovery from Covid-19 in the past six months is required for entry to bars, restaurants, cinemas and other entertainment venues. But the current wave of infections is mainly affecting the southern and eastern parts of the nation, where vaccine uptake is lower.People wait to be vaccinated at a vaccination center in Berlin on November 3. The pace of vaccinations have been picking up as officials call on the public to get immunized. \"For the first time since August, over 500,000 citizens in Germany were vaccinated in one day yesterday,\" Germany\\'s acting Health Minister Jens Spahn tweeted Thursday. He said this included 381,560 booster vaccinations, \"which are so important to break this 4th wave.\" Germany\\'s vaccine advisory committee recommended boosters for everyone over the age of 18 on Thursday as it attempts to address waning immunity from a two-dose regimen. Despite the widescale availability of vaccines this winter compared to the last, Europe\\'s Delta-variant fueled fourth wave has made it the only region last week to see an increase in Covid-19 related deaths, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. If the measures proposed by the coalition are agreed, they would move Germany closer in line with its southern neighbor Austria, where a lockdown specifically targeted at unvaccinated people came into force Monday. It bans unvaccinated people -- more than a third of the country\\'s population -- from leaving their homes except for a few specific reasons. People gather at the annual Christmas market during the first day of a nationwide lockdown for the uninoculated on November 15.On Thursday, it was announced that the lockdown would be extended to the entire population living in the provinces of Salzburg and Upper Austria as \\'\\'new coronavirus infections continue to rise sharply,\" Salzburg\\'s local government wrote on its website.Austria, where vaccine uptake is lower than Germany, is suffering an intense wave of infections and reported a record 15,145 new daily on Thursday. The country\\'s seven-day incidence rate also hit a record of 989 cases per 100,000 people.  By contrast, Spain and Portugal have avoided the brunt of the winter wave after posting the highest vaccination rates in Europe.France, which has almost 75% of its total population vaccinated, is weathering the new infection spike better than its neighbors.Nearly 5 million French have received their Covid booster vaccine shot, French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said in an interview with French media LCI on Thursday. \"This is a lot. It puts us above most of our European neighbors, but it\\'s still too little,\" Attal said. \"We must continue.\"CNN\\'s Rob Picheta, Martin Goillandeau, Xiaofei Xu and Meredith Ruleman contributed to this report.

Hirskyj-Douglas observed that in the current pet tech market, the user experience is centered around the owner, rather than the dog, and so she set out to change that.After creating and testing her device, she published her findings in a research paper for the Association for Computer Machinery Digital Library -- and says they\\'re particularly relevant at a time when some pets are experiencing separation anxiety after spending months with their owners during the pandemic.\"No one\\'s really done this sort of stuff before,\" Hirskyj-Douglas told CNN. \"Where do we even begin making things from a dog viewpoint?\"Read MoreThis farm sanctuary will let you invite a llama or goat to your next video meetingTo answer that question, she didn\\'t have to look too far -- her own 10-year-old black Labrador retriever, Zach, provided ample inspiration for how such a communication device could work. With the help of researchers from her former workplace, Aalto University in Finland, Hirskyj-Douglas created the DogPhone -- a sensor hidden inside a ball that triggers a video call from a computer whenever it is moved.Although Hirskyj-Douglas isn\\'t completely sure that Zach was aware he was calling her each time he used the ball, she said she never trained him to use it, and she believes more dog-centric tech is needed on the market.\"The way that we make devices for dogs currently is not really the same standard as we make for humans --  we\\'re treating them a bit like they don\\'t really have any agency,\" she said. \"The animals that we keep in our lives are a lot smarter and deserve a lot better technology than what we have for them.\"Hirskyj-Douglas holds the sensor that triggers a video call in the DogPhone.Whether he was aware or not, Zach kept Hirskyj-Douglas\\'s phone ringing -- by the end of the experiment, he was calling her up to five times a day. But when she tried to call him, he didn\\'t always answer -- which he could do by moving the ball. \"I went into it with a very much open mind,\" Hirskyj-Douglas said. \"Originally I kept thinking of that famous quote, \\'he\\'s just not that into you,\\' when I was ringing him and he was just not answering my calls.\" However, there was also a downside to knowing that Zach had his phone just one paw away -- Hirskyj-Douglas said she came to expect calls from her canine at certain times and became anxious about his whereabouts if he didn\\'t phone.Cows prefer to co-moo-nicate in person, research suggestsUltimately, the researcher is planning to focus on her day job, but she says she will continue to explore dog-centric devices in her work and would love to collaborate with organizations on implementing them. Although Hirskyj-Douglas and Zach will continue to work together on new technologies, they have their ups and downs just like any human and their dog. \"My dog\\'s a big sniffer, grass-eater, going around, this sort of thing,\" she said. \"He\\'s very independent, my dog. So I say we go on walks together, but usually he\\'s on his separate walk from me.\"',\n",

Together with its plural and feminine form, called collectively as \"iel, ielle, iels, ielles,\" this new addition to the French language has triggered strong opposition from some French politicians. \"The Petit Robert, a dictionary that we thought was a reference, has just integrated on its site the words \"iel, ielle, iels, ielles,\" said French lawmaker Fran챌ois Jolivet, from French President Emmanuel Macron\\'s party La R챕publique en Marche, in a tweet on Tuesday. French speakers angry about spelling change for thousands of wordsRead More\"Its authors are therefore militants of a cause that has nothing to do with France: #wokisme,\" Jolivet said. His anger resonated among other French lawmakers, including the Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer. \"Inclusive writing is not the future of the French language,\" Blanquer said in a tweet on Tuesday. \"Hence, even though our students are consolidating their fundamental knowledge, they cannot have this as a reference.\" CNN has reached out to the French Academy, the governing body of the French language, for comment. French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal reiterated the government\\'s position \"not to use inclusive writing in all official documents and administrative documents,\" at his weekly press conference on Wednesday. Le Robert responded with a statement on Wednesday saying that it is simply trying to reflect recent changes in the French language that it has noticed. It admitted that the general use of \"iel\" is still low, and the dictionary entry flags that the word is \"rare.\" But the editorial committee thought it would be useful to include the entry and clarify its meanings for people so that they can decide if they want to use it or reject it. Arbiters of the French language say \\'Covid\\' is feminine\"Le Robert\\'s mission is to observe the evolution of a French language in movement, diverse, and to report on it,\" the statement said. It also said in the statement that most of the reactions it received are positive. The outrage came as France is growing increasingly uncomfortable with cultural influence from other nations.

He says moving to France and being racially abused by children at school was the first time he became conscious that he was seen as a Black person in society. Thuram says he was subject to racist abuse, such as monkey chants, throughout his playing career, notably after signing for Italian club Parma in 1996. He recently wrote a book entitled White Thinking: Behind the Mask of Racial Identity which addresses how societal norms still work to divide people and fuel systemic racism. He says education is the key to tackling the issue in a more meaningful way, both in football and in wider society. There have been many incidents of racism throughout world football this season, with players being abused both on the pitch and through social media. Recently, Germany\\'s Olympic football team walked off the pitch during a friendly match against Honduras after one of the German players was racially abused, according to the German Football Association (DFB). Thuram urged athletes to not be complicit and to continue using their platforms to be activists for social causes. \"You have to know that the authorities are going to be able to promote more equality in society because we\\'re going to oblige them to do so,\" he said. \"That\\'s why you need to educate each and every one to understand that we have a role to play, and we have to have the courage to denounce injustices. \"It\\'s the number of people demanding change that will force the institutions to change.\" READ: Kaepernick details intensive training regime in rare interview as he refuses to give up on NFL returnThuram (left) playing for Parma in 1997.Following a number of high-profile incidents in 2019, European football\\'s governing body UEFA introduced a three-step protocol for referees when combating racism in the stadium. It gave officials the option to abandon the game \"as a final resort\" if racism continued after restarting the match for a second time. Meanwhile, world football\\'s governing body FIFA says it is continuously working with the EU Commission to eradicate discrimination from the game. \"There is no place for racial discrimination in football or in society,\" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said earlier this year. \"As the governing body of football worldwide, FIFA recognizes and embraces its responsibility to lead the fight against discrimination.\" Since retiring from professional football in 2008, Thuram has watched his son, Marcus, follow his footsteps into the pro game. Now playing in Germany for Borussia Monchengladbach, Marcus was one of the many players to take a knee during a game following the death of George Floyd in 2020. Other players used their social media platforms to share messages of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, and English Premier League clubs still take a knee before every match in order to raise awareness of discrimination. \"What was extremely interesting after the death of George Floyd was that many of the players who took the knee were young players,\" Thuram said. \"That\\'s something very important and it shows why we have to educate the youngest people in society because, as a general rule, it is them who enact the change.\"READ: Muhammad Ali -- the glory and the struggleJUST WATCHEDRomelu Lukaku: Football superstar calls for social media CEOs and footballers to meetReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRomelu Lukaku: Football superstar calls for social media CEOs and footballers to meet 04:52Pushing for a better futureThuram has praised White players such as Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson for addressing the subject of racial injustice but is aware that athletes, particularly Black athletes, could face criticism for speaking out.

              " ' (CNN)When the cards were dealt, Chris Moneymaker could hardly have been happy.Sure, he was the chip leader at the 2003 World Series of Poker (WSOP) having miraculously, and literally, battled against the odds all the way to make it to the final table out of 839 entrants. And now, from his initial $86 satellite entry fee granting him a seat at the WSOP -- the price of admission to enter the tournament at Binion\\'s Hotel in Las Vegas could have been $10,000 -- a million-dollar payout was guaranteed.Over the course of one week in May, 837 contenders had been eliminated, leaving this amateur online player going up against seasoned professional Sam Farha. And as they played heads-up Texas Hold \\'Em, Moneymaker must have wanted the glory of winning the most prestigious prize in poker, to say nothing of the $2.5 million on offer to the winner.And regardless of Farha\\'s starting hand, Moneymaker\\'s five of diamonds and four of spades did not exactly inspire confidence. But by this point, destiny was clearly calling.All in the nameRead MoreJudging by his name, you might think that Chris Moneymaker was meant to have been involved with dealing in sums. And you would be right.Growing up in Knoxville, Tennessee, Moneymaker became an accountant and -- as he told CNN Sport as part of an interview discussing his involvement working with VELO\\'s sponsorship with the World Series of Poker, who are highlighting how poker skills can translate beyond the table -- he acknowledged how translation also played a part in his surname.\"My father is Moneymaker, and we\\'ve had a long line of males in our family tree,\" he says. \"From what I\\'ve been told [...] they made silver and gold coins.\"The name was originally Nurmacher. And when they went to England, they took the literal translation of someone that made the silver and gold coins and it was Moneymaker.\"Chris Moneymaker competing during the main event at the World Series of Poker in 2015.Moneymaker\\'s love of card and table games resulted in poker becoming more of a regular occurrence in his routine. But it wasn\\'t likely to lead to a career change and, even his partaking in an $86 satellite tournament, leading to a follow up tournament where a seat at the famed WSOP was at stake, wasn\\'t his pressing priority.In fact, Moneymaker says not winning that second tournament was more important -- to the extent of trying to lose on purpose -- because a fourth-place spot meant a cash prize.Moneymaker says \"it was a complete mistake\" that he even entered to try and land a place at the WSOP, \"I thought I was playing for cash. We got down to five-handed [five players left] and I\\'m actually chip leader and I\\'m trying to actively get fourth place because I want the $8,000 in cash.\"I don\\'t want the seat to go play in the World Series of Poker to go play against the best players in the world because I\\'m just an amateur player playing with friends. I\\'ve never played against a pro in my life. And $8,000 would go a long way to paying off my bills and helping with things around the house.\"My goal was to win that eight grand. And a buddy talked me into taking the seat, and that\\'s how I got the World Series seat. And the rest is history.\"Like a Hollywood scriptHistory indeed. Moneymaker\\'s magnificent run in 2003 happened to coincide with what he calls \"a dark period\" for the iconic pastime. \"Poker rooms were shutting down,\" Moneymaker notes. \"The game was in decline. It was really sort of a back room, you know -- what you would see in the movies, essentially.\"And movies are an apt metaphor as what Moneymaker achieved was the stuff of legend, usually dreamt up by Hollywood scriptwriters.His victory even coined a phrase: The Moneymaker Effect. In essence, the rapid expansion of online poker players who, inspired by Moneymaker, competed in tournaments against experienced professionals, hoping to make serious money of their own.Television coverage played a part, as the innovative use of cameras showing the \\'hole\\' cards -- the two starting cards with which a player begins each hand -- removed much of the mystery, transforming it into something resembling a sport itself.And never mind 839 players: in 2019, the field of 8,569 players was reportedly the second-largest in WSOP history. The live WSOP was not held last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, but a return to physical action this year finds 6,650 entries, with a prize pool of more than $62 million.For a while, Moneymaker rolled back the years and went fairly deep into the 2021 tournament, eying a second WSOP bracelet, but eventually exiting in a respectable 260th place, netting $38,600.\\'The Bluff of the Century\\'Back in 2003, the then 27-year-old Moneymaker embarked on a run where, fueled by Red Bull and water, he knocked out some of the biggest names in the game -- a sports David and Goliath tale for the ages.Certain hands have since become the stuff of legend, notably the flush (all five cards from the same suit) which knocked out the legendary Johnny Chan, whose own flush of hearts lost because Moneymaker\\'s included the all-conquering ace.Moneymaker dispatched the great Phil Ivey in a rollercoaster of a hand, where at one point Moneymaker looked certain to win, then lose, before yet another ace got him out of trouble, and sent Ivey packing.And when it was Moneymaker against Farha to decide the title, a monumentally brave bluff saw Moneymaker go all in, meaning he was essentially willing to bet his tournament life on nothing more than the high card of a king.Farha didn\\'t just have the upper hand in every sense -- a pair of nines -- but knew it. \"You must have missed your flush draw, huh?\" Farha says at one point.The issue was that if his read of the situation was incorrect, Farha would have been eliminated and thus decided to fold. ESPN announcer Norman Chad described Moneymaker\\'s move as \"the Bluff of the Century.\"Moneymaker became a poker name overnight after his stunning WSOP-winning run in 2003.And so to that final hand. Moneymaker\\'s five of diamonds and four of clubs were inferior compared to Farha\\'s jack of hearts and 10 of diamonds, but another miracle took place when the flop of three community cards was revealed by the dealer.Not only did Moneymaker match his own cards with a five of spades and four of clubs to give him two pair, but Farha actually had top pair with the jack on the board, which made it appear he was in a better position.This time, Farha would go all in, which was an easy call for Moneymaker. The turn card produced an eight of diamonds, and the fifth and final river card was a five of hearts, to secure victory and give Moneymaker a full house in the process. \"This is beyond fairytale. It\\'s inconceivable!\" exclaimed Chad.Nearly 20 years on, Moneymaker can seemingly recall every moment. \"When you could see an amateur like me pull off a bluff like that, it gave everybody hope that they could do it too,\" he says in reference to the so-called \"Bluff of the Century.\"When it is put to him that his critics have said he simply got lucky, Moneymaker doesn\\'t necessarily object, but adds one important caveat.\"You can\\'t win a poker tournament without getting lucky. That\\'s just part of the game. But you have to put yourself in position to be lucky though, too. That\\'s what makes the game so good. If the best player won every single time, no one would play.\"',\n",

The coffin also gets to work decomposing the body, speeding up the process by which nature can absorb the nutrients of the deceased.Hendrikx\\'s company Loop is not the first to hitch itself to the eco-hearse. Cremated human remains can be placed in pods to grow trees or cast into artificial coral reefs, while coffins made from wicker, macram챕 and cardboard are all on the market. Woodland burials, where coffins and clothing are made from all-natural materials, are also experiencing a resurgence. And when actor Luke Perry died in 2019 he was buried in a \"mushroom suit\" designed to help decompose his body. But using mycelium to enclose the body in a \"living coffin\" is a novel approach.JUST WATCHEDThis man thinks mushrooms are the secret to an eco-friendly deathReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThis man thinks mushrooms are the secret to an eco-friendly death 02:40The motivation is simple: some funeral practices are bad for the environment. In the US alone over 4 million gallons of embalming fluid are used every year for burials, according to the non-profit Green Burial Council. Embalming fluid contains toxic ingredients such as formaldehyde, which can leach into the ground. Cremation has its own issues, releasing considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and possibly heavy metals if present in the body (the US Environmental Protection Agency calculated that nearly 2 tons of mercury, found in dental fillings, were emitted by human cremations in 2014). Read MoreRead: Fighting to preserve the last quiet places on a noisy planet\"What really frustrates me is that when I die, I\\'m polluting the Earth. I\\'m waste,\" says Hendrikx. He describes the body as a \"walking trash bin of 219 chemicals\" even before factoring in the metals, wood and glue typically used in coffins. \"Our current burial processes lead to material depletion, soil pollution and CO2 emissions,\" he adds. \"We created a super-industrial process for one of the most natural processes on Earth.\"But given the right treatment, the body becomes \"a beautiful bag of compost.\" Mushrooms, Hendrikx says, \"are known as the world\\'s largest recycler,\" turning dead organic matter into new plant life. \"Why are we not using this?\"The \"Living Cocoon\" designed by Bob Hendrikx\\'s company Loop.Loop\\'s \"Living Cocoon\" is comprised of lab-cultivated mycelium, woodchips and secret ingredients, placed in a mold and grown into a coffin shape over the course of a week. Once completed, moss -- full of microorganisms -- is packed into the bottom, onto which the body is laid. Once the structure comes in contact with damp soil the mycelium comes to life and the process begins.Loop has partnered with biomaterials pioneers Ecovative to test the product, which Hendrikx says will decompose in 45 days. \"It\\'s not gone,\" he adds, \"because it\\'s then working on your body.\" He says calculations made by Loop with expert input indicate a corpse will fully decompose in two to three years.The zero-waste \\'Greenhouse\\' is providing a blueprint for future homesThe coffin, which is manufactured in Delft, is on sale for ??,495 ($1,700). Joerg Vieweg, an owner of funeral homes in Germany, is one of Hendrikx\\'s customers. Vieweg says the mycelium coffin is \"a good example of how to achieve something ecologically with little change in the tradition of farewell.\" \"(It) does not fundamentally change the process and traditions (of preparing a body for burial),\" he adds, which makes burial in a mycelium coffin more socially acceptable.Read: Lost species appear alive again in \\'The Zoo of Extinct Animals\\'To date around 100 burials have been conducted with the Living Cocoon in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, says Hendrikx. He says laws in some European countries are more favorable for the coffin than others. \"It\\'s a super-conservative market,\" he adds, \"the same as it\\'s ever been.\"\"I think we are less traditional (in the Netherlands),\" argues Heidi van Haastert, branch director of the BGNU, the country\\'s association for funeral companies.\"The challenge at this moment is how can we convince families to organize a sustainable funeral?\" she adds. \"Consumers are not aware of (sustainable funeral options), because the problem is, how many times do you organize a funeral? There\\'s only once or twice in your life that you\\'re responsible.\"The coffin has already been used for funerals in multiple European countries.Van Haastert says funeral companies in the Netherlands are now training their employees to discuss climate-neutral options with bereaved families, and she hopes new legislative guidelines will be introduced for alternative funerals.While she describes Loop\\'s product as \"niche\" at present, she speculates that \"within five years (people) will ask more for these kinds of coffins.\"Meet the \\'seed detective\\' on a mission to save our rarest vegetables Hendrikx believes he\\'s found a positive solution, and as Loop looks to expand, it aims to create coffins using fungi samples local to their final destination to ensure they have optimal environmental impact. \"Instead of doing a bad thing, or less bad thing (after death), you can actually do something good,\" he says, making the case for his invention.Vieweg believes the funeral industry is \"facing a tremendous change of paradigm.\" \"People are creative and look(ing) for sustainable solutions to protect our environment,\" she says. \"The rituals that have been lived up to now will also survive and new ones will develop. To experience this process is exciting and challenging.\"',\n",

The new guidance follows a two-year consultation process with more than 250 athletes and concerned stakeholders.Released on Tuesday, the framework is not legally binding and will place the responsibility on individual sporting federations to determine if an athlete was at a disproportionate advantage.The 10-point document will come into place after Beijing 2022, but not every sport is expected to be prepared to find a solution for their athletes before Paris 2024. \"What we are offering to all the international federations is our expertise and a dialogue, rather than jumping to a conclusion,\" said Kaveh Mehrabi, director of the IOC\\'s athletes\\' department.Read More\"This is a process that we have to go through with each federation on a case-by-case basis and see what is required.\"Weightlifter Laurel Hubbard becomes first ?땚ut transgender woman to compete at the Olympics, fails to register a lift This new framework replaces the IOC\\'s previous guidelines, which were issued in 2015.

But this is guidance, it\\'s not an absolute rule.\"There is debate in the scientific community as to whether androgenic hormones like testosterone are useful markers of athletic advantage. The new guidelines also apply to athletes with differences of sex development (DSD), such as the South African 800m runner Caster Semenya, whose testosterone levels have been recorded as too high to compete as a woman in some events. The announcement follows the 2020 Summer Games, which have been labelled as the most inclusive Games to date with Outsports reporting in July that there would be at least 180 out LGBTQ+ Olympians in Tokyo and at least four athletes who are out and either trans or non-binary.

              " ' (CNN)Last month, Austrian police made a remarkable discovery. In a raid on a house in the town of Baden, they found an arsenal of weapons and 1,200 kilograms of ammunition -- as well as Nazi paraphernalia and a large amount of gunpowder. Altogether some 50 weapons, including submachine guns and pump-action rifles, were seized. According to a police statement, the house belonged to a 53-year-old man who is \"suspected of national socialist Nazi activities,\" including sharing numerous files on Internet forums. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said of the raid: \"The consistent action against right-wing extremism is not only part of the historical responsibility, but also a clear advocacy of our democratic coexistence in Austria.\"It wasn\\'t the first action against alleged neo-Nazis in Austria this year. In July, police seized automatic weapons and hand grenades in coordinated raids against a biker gang whose leader planned to establish a \"militia of the respectable\" that would \"overturn the system.\"Support for Nazism is a criminal offense in Austria. The most prominent neo-Nazi figure is Gottfried Kuessel, who was sentenced to a nine-year jail term in 2013 for propagating Nazism online. It was his second conviction. Read MoreGerman police stop far-right vigilantes attempting to patrol Polish borderBernhard Weidinger, who studies the far right at the Documentation Archive of the Austrian Resistance in Vienna, says that the criminalization of Nazi ideology has ensured that it is neither particularly strong nor organized. \"But what we do have is a very high frequency of weapons finds,\" he told CNN.Neo-Nazi activity in Europe is frequently associated with biker gangs, organized crime and football fans. In Austria, a group called the Immortal follow the club Rapid Vienna, sometimes displaying the Reich War flag at matches. In Italy, fan groups known as Ultras adopt fascist slogans and monikers.Austrian neo-Nazi activists frequently connect with similar groups in Germany, according to authorities, because they perceive themselves as part of a greater German Reich. After the seizure of another arsenal of weapons late in 2020, Interior Minister Nehammer spoke of links between the five arrested individuals and far right cells in Germany, as well as connections with organized crime and drug trafficking.In Austria, as elsewhere in Europe, the neo-Nazi scene includes virulent strains of both anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim racism.In January this year, an Austrian rapper by the name of Mr Bond was arrested and charged with \"producing and broadcasting Nazi ideas and incitement to hatred.\" One of his neo-Nazi songs was used by a man as he live streamed a deadly attack on a synagogue in Germany in 2019. Some of the weapons that were seized from a house in Baden, Austria, in October 2021. That attack came a year after a third (35%) of Austrians told CNN that Jewish people were at risk of racist violence in their country. Nearly half (45%) said anti-Semitism was a growing problem in their country. The findings were part of a ComRes/CNN survey exploring anti-Semitism in seven European countries.In Austria, 12% of people aged 18 to 34 said they had never heard of the Holocaust. Austria also had the highest number of people in the survey -- four out of 10 adults -- who said they knew \"just a little\" about the Holocaust. And a third of Austrians (32%) said Jewish people have too much influence on business and finance around the world, echoing a long-standing anti-Semitic trope.The findings came from a ComRes survey for CNN of 7,092 adults online in seven countries between September 7 and September 20, 2018. Data was weighted to be representative of each country based on age, gender and region. Austria is grappling with the legacy of anti-Semitism in other ways.  For almost a decade, a statue in Vienna has been at the center of that troubled history. It is of Karl Lueger, the city\\'s mayor at the beginning of the 20th century. Lueger exploited anti-Jewish feeling in his bid for office, emphasizing Christian and Germanic supremacy, and was much admired by Adolf Hitler. The bronze statue, four meters high, has been defaced but still stands in a prominent position in a Vienna square. City authorities decided this month that it would remain in place but be set in context.  One group that took up the cause of protecting the statue was the Identit채re Bewegung 횜sterreich (IBO) -- the Austrian branch of a European movement that describes itself as Identitarian. Its leader, Martin Sellner, visited the statue after it was daubed with the word \"Shame.\"Sellner has become a leading light in the Identitarian movement which opposes mass migration and wants Europe to have a homogenic white and Christian identity. They see this identity being sold out by political elites committed to multiculturalism. Austrian authorities prosecuted him and 16 others using anti-Mafia laws in 2018, accusing them of hate speech and criminal association. After a high-profile trial they were acquitted.More damaging for the Identitarians in Austria was the revelation that they had received a donation from the man who carried out the attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019, and that Sellner had been in touch with him. How the \\'parasite\\' QAnon conspiracy cult went global Sellner said in a video statement that he had nothing to do with the attack and said the money would be given to charity. Even so, Bernhard Weidinger told CNN, the connection seriously damaged the IBO in the eyes of much of the public. Analysts make a distinction between traditional neo-Nazis --- whose activities are based on violence and crime --- and the emerging Identitarian groups, which are political. Besides Sellner and the IBO in Austria, they include G챕n챕ration Identitaire in France and the Neue Rechte (New Right) in Germany. However, both the Identitarians and neo-Nazi ideologists have taken advantage of the conspiracy theories that flourished with the QAnon movement and protests against vaccination policies during the Covid-19 pandemic. Sellner has said that such movements should be exploited for the only issue that truly matters: resisting mass migration.In Vienna, Gottfried Kuessel -- now out of jail -- and others previously associated with neo-Nazism joined marches against lockdown. Weidinger says it\\'s notable that they also appear to have attracted a younger generation -- people in their twenties -- to join them. They have also begun to organize their own protest for the first time in many years, he told CNN. Nearly 40,000 people attended a Berlin rally in August last year to protest against lockdown but also against the \"deep?칢tate.\" The event was notable for the number of far-right groups that joined in (such as the German Reichsburger movement) and for its adulation of then US President Donald Trump.In a video message, Sellner told the protesters they could mobilize a \"broad, patriotic mass\" to fight the \"grand strategy\" of global elites. Members of the Reichsburger group tried to force their way into the parliament, a symbolic act meant to recall the Nazis\\' burning of the Reichstag. This is how dangerous right-wing media *actually* isIn both Germany and Austria, the more extreme factions speak of \"Day X\" -- an apocalyptic fantasy when democratic institutions will collapse in a tide of violence and a neo-Nazi state will be born. It was a persistent theme on the Telegram channel of Nordkreuz, a German group of far-right extremists that included police officers and former soldiers. Another such group was Revolution Chemnitz, which planned an attack designed to accelerate \"a turning point in history.\" The \\'mainstream\\' rightThere is some ideological overlap between Identitarian groups and Europe\\'s established right-wing parties, such as the Freedom Party in Austria, the National Rally (formerly the National Front) in France, and Matteo Salvini\\'s Northern League in Italy.In July, 16 far-right parties signed up to a statement on the future of Europe, warning that \"European nations should be based on tradition, respect for the culture and history of European states, respect for Europe\\'s Judeo-Christian heritage and the common values that unite our nations.\" Lena Floerl (R), 25, takes part in a \"vigil of shame\" on October 6, 2020, to prevent city authorities removing graffiti from the statue of Karl Lueger, a former mayor of Vienna famous for his anti-Semitic views.\"In a time when Europe is facing a serious demographic crisis with low birth rates and ageing population, pro-family policy making should be an answer instead of mass immigration,\" they said. Sellner and other Identitarians have used almost exactly the same language, warning of the \"Great Replacement\" in which white Europeans are swamped by a tide of migration.Bernhard Weidinger says that the Identitarians offer what he describes as \"critical solidarity\" to the Freedom Party (FPO), which dominates the right in Austria. He says that now the Freedom Party is in opposition in Austria after a spell in a government coalition it has tilted further right, depriving the IBO of territory of its own.Pay attention to the far right\\'s use of memes to stir extremismIndeed, some FPO members have had an ambivalent relationship with the neo-Nazi fringe in Austria. In 2018, a senior official, Udo Landbauer, resigned his position because of a previous association with a group accused of being neo-Nazis. Landbauer denied knowing about anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi content in a book published by the group. The European far-right is a fractured environment, where political activism and calls to violence overlap, and groups grow and morph quickly. Much of it is online or underground, but it has been given new impetus -- in both Europe and America -- by lockdowns, vaccination mandates and an epidemic of conspiracy theories. Where it coalesces -- at least in spirit -- is on the issues of cultural identity and migration, which groups such as the Austrian IBO regard as an imminent existential threat. In June this year, the Austrian parliament passed a law banning the symbols of the IBO and another group, \"The Austrians,\" essentially conflating them with terror groups. The IBO responded on its website that: \"Austria is thus partially and purposefully abolishing democracy for two patriotic groups. The autocratic censors will not get rid of us.\"',\n",

We have to thank the many people who have made this journey possible,\" Garcia Aguilera said in his first public comment since leaving Cuba.\"I have been without communication for several days and need to update on the situation of other members of the Archipelago,\" he added, referring to his opposition group.The organizer of protests that were thwarted by Cuban police had not been seen since a mob of hardline pro-government supporters surrounded his house on Sunday, a spokesman for Archipelago group said on Tuesday.Read MoreMagdiel Jorge Castro told CNN that the last time activists spoke with Garc챠a Aguilera was on Sunday at 6 p.m. local time. A member of the group went to his house on Tuesday to try to locate him, but after knocking for more than an hour at his door, no one opened or answered, he added.Garcia Aguilera faced possible arrest and trial in Cuba for his role in organizing the protests -- intended to call for greater political freedoms -- which had been planned for Monday but never took place.Cuban police arrested at least 11 people while government agents and supporters had \"besieged\" 50 others inside their homes to forestall the demonstration, the Havana-based independent human rights organization Cubalex told CNN. Cuban activists also said they were blockaded inside their homes on Sunday and Monday. Protests are permitted under the Cuban constitution -- but in practice, police routinely arrest anyone suspected anti-government activity and protestors face lengthy prison sentences. The government had vowed not to allow the demonstrations, claiming they were a pretext to stir up trouble on the communist-run island, and that they had been secretly organized by Cuban exiles and the US government. There was a heavy police across Cuba on Monday morning as authorities prepared to face potential protesters. Ultimately, streets remained quiet, however -- evidence of the chilling effects of the government\\'s warnings.',\n",

Loud bangs rang out over the crowds and a dense cloud of smoke hung overhead. Belarusian state media BeITA reported that the water cannons used by Polish forces sprayed a yellow liquid that caused burning, and that people were suffocating and feeling sick from the smoke. A CNN team was hit by the water fired by Polish guards.

He knew where it was coming from was a place of love and commitment,\" said Goldwyn.Isha Price, one of Venus and Serena\\'s three older half-sisters, was an early collaborator on the script, providing details and recollections that made the movie the story of the family. Richard Williams has been in ill health for years and did not take part.Venus Williams said she got emotional watching it. \"Just like watery eyes, and the moment, the family moments of togetherness and the father-daughter moments are like, ooh,\" she said.While the film uses authentic players as doubles for much of the action, actors Demi Singleton (Serena) and Saniyya Sidney (Venus) had to undergo months of intensive training to learn how to hit the ball, serve and play the kind of power tennis the young sisters were known for.\"They\\'re such extraordinary people and they\\'re very nice.

              " ' (CNN)Alarm bells are ringing in Europe\\'s halls of diplomacy. In recent days, senior Western officials have expressed their concern at the thousands of Russian forces that have appeared near the eastern borders of Ukraine.On Monday, NATO\\'s Secretary-General warned Moscow against \"potential aggressive actions\" after Ukrainian officials estimated there were 90,000 Russian troops \"near the border and in the temporarily occupied territories,\" as well as in the Black Sea.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that the US was \"concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity\" and mentioned the possibility that Russia may be \"attempting to rehash\" its 2014 invasion of its neighbor. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Russia to \"adopt a posture of restraint\" because any attempt to \"undermine Ukraine\\'s territorial integrity would have serious consequences.\"The questions that require answers are: 1) How immediately dangerous is the situation; 2) What can the Western alliance do, if anything, to dissuade Russia from further provocation; and 3) What does the Russian President Vladimir Putin actually want? In private, European diplomats and officials answer these questions by saying they don\\'t believe the situation is the same as in 2014, when Russian operatives invaded Ukraine and annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. Armored personnel carriers take part in an amphibious landing exercise held by army corps and naval infantry units of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at the Opuk range in Crimea in October 2021. Read MoreOrysia Lutsevych, a Ukrainian analyst at Chatham House, agrees. \"It\\'s the best war you can fight without boots hitting the ground. Unlike 2014 this is not about territory, but about undermining Ukraine\\'s persistent movement towards the West and telling the West that Russia has a legitimate presence in this region.\" However, those officials do fear that Putin has created something of a Catch-22 that he is very happy to exploit. Putin knows that if he builds up troops, the West has to respond. That means statements like the above from senior US, French, German and EU officials. The rub is that statements and other measures have not historically forced Putin\\'s hand. \"Russia has demonstrated many times that it is able to wait out sanctions,\" said Cathryn Cluver Ashbrook, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. \"Putin knows that sanctions are difficult to sell to certain groups at home when they can indirectly impact German business or energy supplies in France,\" because companies cannot work with Russian companies.The Catch-22 is that Putin receives a legitimacy boost when these Western leaders are forced to talk with him in order to deescalate tense situations. \"Every time someone like Merkel is forced to pick up the phone and talk to him about preventing a crisis, he becomes simultaneously the cause and solution to the problem. It makes him seem very powerful at home and elsewhere in Europe,\" said a senior EU diplomat. There is another situation unfolding in Europe that could allow Putin to play both foe and friend. The border between Belarus and Poland is playing witness to a migration crisis that has been lurching toward violent escalation. On Tuesday morning, tensions erupted when migrants trying to gain entry to Europe threw rocks at Polish border guards, who responded with water cannons.Violence erupts on Poland-Belarus border as Polish guards fire water cannon on migrants throwing rocks  Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been accused of manufacturing the crisis by directing migrants from the Middle East and Asia to the border. A sudden influx to any country within the EU creates the real possibility of a political crisis and headache for Brussels. The nature of the EU\\'s internal borders mean that once you have entered a country like Poland, it becomes easier to move around within the bloc. This would almost certainly lead to member states turning on one another, sowing divisions within the bloc and undermining the EU\\'s unity -- something that makes Putin and Lukashenko very happy. To make matters more complicated, Poland is currently in a protracted spat with Brussels over Warsaw\\'s lack of compliance with EU law. A senior EU official explained to CNN that Poland was \"already using this crisis to argue for unity on the issue of migration. The problem is, solidarity on this will be taken by Poland as collaboration in their own rule-breaking that undermines the Union.\" While Putin has denied any involvement in this redirection of people, he has defended Lukashenko\\'s handling of the crisis. Russia is also Belarus\\' most important ally, helping keep Lukashenko -- a man often called Europe\\'s last dictator -- stay in power. Most analysts say it is extremely unlikely such a confrontational policy would have been carried out without at least consulting the Kremlin. This type of crisis allows Putin to enjoy supporting Lukashenko and stoking the fire, while also playing peacekeeper. If Putin made it clear he wanted Lukashenko to stop, it is almost certain he would.Vladimir Putin (R) meets with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi in May 2021.It\\'s not clear what Putin\\'s long-term plan is for either crisis. It is, however, a safe bet that the West looking disunited and impotent while its borders face being overrun is deemed good news for the Russian President, and the crisis will get steady coverage on Russian state TV. And the West has looked impotent in the face of Russian aggression many times over the past decade. \"The West\\'s diplomatic toolbox is depressingly empty when it comes to Russia,\" said global affairs analyst Michael Bociurkiw. Tensions are rising on the Poland-Belarus border. Here\\'s what you need to knowHe believes that the combination of American indifference, Europe\\'s cognitive dissonance on what it wants from Russia and Putin\\'s relative inability to do any real harm to the more powerful Western nations have left Putin with the impression that he can essentially do what he wants and get nothing more than harsh words. \"Lots of Eastern European nations are now terrified that the US and its closest allies are just not interested in foreign affairs any more, especially since the withdrawal from Afghanistan,\" Bociurkiw said. As serious as the situations in both Ukraine and Belarus are, it is entirely possible that they are easily explained as relatively weak leaders like Putin and Lukashenko flexing their muscles in parts of the world they know they can get away with it. Realistically, Putin simply is not a major threat to the West. The tragedy of that reality is that for those who live in his sphere of influence, a lack of pushback from the international community means that a man who despises playing by the rules has as good as absolute power over their lives. Whether that becomes a strong enough incentive for countries like the US, Germany, France and the UK to act, should the aggression get worse, is really anyone\\'s guess.',\n",

Meanwhile, 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel continued his impressive season with another excellent performance, receiving and rushing for a touchdown apiece for a total of 133 yards. With 979 total receiving yards this season, the 25-year-old is second only to the Rams\\' Cooper Kupp.Garoppolo\\'s assured passing served as a stark contrast to Rams QB Matthew Stafford, who -- despite eventually throwing for a touchdown and 243 yards -- was intercepted twice by Jimmie Ward, the second for a pick-six. The 49ers set to snap against the Rams. It is the first time since his 2009 rookie season that Stafford -- bested by the Titans\\' Kevin Byard last week -- has been pick-sixed in consecutive games.Stafford and the Rams head into a bye week that will give them the chance to take stock before facing the Green Bay Packers on November 28, as coach Sean McVay looks to halt their recent slide and close the gap on the NFC West-leading Arizona Cardinals (8-2). \"Concentration lapses, guys just not making plays that they\\'re accustomed to,\" McVay answered when asked by reporters what cost his team.\"Certainly, it was very uncharacteristic for a lot of guys.

Towards the end of my first spell but constantly throughout I knew there was something wrong. I started taking medication for my mental health. It was really tough.\"Read MoreAsked to compare his treatment at Yorkshire to his everyday life, Rafiq said: \"My every day life for as long as I\\'ve known has been cricket. It\\'s difficult to compare. Cricket is worse than society. If we make changes in cricket, we make changes in society. Everyone is responsible for the society we live in. Saying it is a societal problem is a cop out.\"\"Do I believe I lost my career to racism? Yes I do,\" added Rafiq.\"Maybe what was written for me is this ... I\\'m a massive believer that everything happens for a reason and hopefully in five years\\' time we\\'re going to see a big change and I can look back at it, that I did something that is far bigger than any runs I got or any wickets I got.

The club\\'s statement did not specify which. For other allegations, the statement said \"there was insufficient evidence.\" But it said that \"several\" of Rafiq\\'s allegations were upheld, and that he had been \"the victim of inappropriate behaviour.\"At least one player admitted to regularly using the term \\'P***\\' -- a word widely seen as a slur and used against people of South Asian and Middle Eastern origin in Britain -- when talking to Rafiq, according to a report seen by ESPNcricinfo and detailed this month.But the report said that the player ?땓n question was exonerated because ?땤he review panel saw the comments as \"banter\" between the two players, ESPN?땉ricinfo reported. According to ?땤he summary of YCCC\\'s September ??021 report \"Rafiq and his teammate\\'s language towards each other was unacceptable and was racist and derogatory and the Panel did not condone the language.\"In a statement posted to his Twitter account in October, Rafiq said that the investigation into his allegations of racism \"lacked transparency and due process??\" ?땇nd that he had not been allowed to see the report, which he said was completed in August.At least one other player has come forward to corroborate details of the racism Rafiq says he endured at YCCC. Last week, former YCCC academy player Irfan Amjad told the BBC that he was racially abused by a member of staff when he was 16 years old.Amjad alleged that his batting style was criticized by a member of staff, referencing his Pakistani heritage.\"I was stunned, didn\\'t know what to do and was shocked.

Roger Federer remains way out in front with a remarkable 59 career wins.Djokovic, who recently secured a record seventh year-end world No. 1 ranking, hasn't won the ATP Finals title since 2015, despite being arguably the most dominant player on the circuit in that time.The 34-year-old came closest to matching Federer's record of six ATP Finals titles in 2018, when he lost in the final to this year's No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev.While Djokovic and Ruud may be at opposite ends of their careers, the 22-year-old is already showing signs that he could be one of the vaunted next generation that will carry the torch from tennis' old guard.Ruud secured an impressive five ATP titles in 2021 to become the first Norwegian player to qualify for the prestigious year-end ATP Finals, which pits the world's top eight against each other in a round robin format before advancing to a knockout stage.Casper Ruud gave Novak Djokovic a stern test in the first set.Earlier this year, Ruud won three ATP titles in as many weeks, becoming the first man since Andy Murray in 2011 to achieve that feat.The youngster showed impressive resilience against Djokovic on Monday, notably holding serve in a brutal game to take the first set to a tie break, but is still searching for his first hard court win over a top 10 player.Next up for Djokovic will be the winner of Monday evening's match between Stefanos Tsitsipas and Andrey Rublev.\",\n",

Korda made a birdie on the first playoff hole -- the par-four 18th -- of the Pelican Women\\'s Championship in Florida to claim her fourth Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour win of the season. The birdie edged her ahead of world No. 4 Kim Sei-Young, world No. 5 Lydia Ko and major winner Lexi Thompson in the playoff as the 23-year-old maintained her astronomic rise. The playoff was the finale to a thrilling hour of play where it looked like Korda had thrown away her opportunity for victory right at the last hurdle. Tied for the lead with two holes remaining at the Pelican Golf Club, the American triple-bogeyed the par-four 17th allowing Thompson to move into a one-shot lead.

And again on the 18th in the playoff, Korda was able to make magic with her putter, drilling a putt from 23 feet away to claim her fourth victory of the season and the seventh of her young career. She became the most successful American in an LPGA Tour season since Stacy Lewis won four times in 2012, as well as joining world No. 2 Ko Jin-Young as the only players with four wins on the LPGA Tour this season.Korda also won the gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and in a season where she also won her first major, she was in a pensive mood after the Pelican Women\\'s Championship.\"I think the major [Women\\'s PGA Championship] was the hardest because it was back-to-back events.

              " ' (CNN)\"I\\'m back!\" Superman has returned to Carolina and he marked his return in typical heroic fashion. Cam Newton -- famed for his touchdown celebration where he mimics Clark Kent ripping off his shirt to reveal the Superman logo underneath -- made the perfect start to life back with the Panthers after rejoining the team earlier this week. The quarterback ran for a touchdown on his first play against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, taking off his helmet and shouting \"I\\'m back!\" to the crowd while being mobbed by his teammates. It got even better for Newton later on, throwing for a touchdown on his second touch of the ball minutes later, giving the traveling team a 14-0 first quarter lead. All in all, while he wasn\\'t the starting QB in his return to the team where he had so much success over nine years in Charlotte, Newton proved to be a huge influence in the Panthers\\' big 34-10 victory on the road at the Cardinals. Read More\"I\\'ll put it like this: this time last week, I was eating a bowl of cereal. You feel me? So I told coach [Matt] Rhule it would never happen again,\" Newton told the media afterwards when asked about the emotions about being back with the Panthers. Newton celebrates with fans after  beating the Arizona Cardinals.\"So that just puts things into perspective. After going to church, being with my children and really not even watching football, it was just about maximizing the person I need to be and so for that it was just all a rush of emotions. But yet I know a lot of people in the media, the titles of the newspapers, the blogs, they want to make it about me and it\\'s not about me and I keep sayin\\' this. \"This was an impeccable team win.\"Newton, a former No. 1 overall pick by the Panthers in 2011, left in 2019. He spent last season at the New England Patriots, starting 15 games before being released in training camp after Mac Jones became the chosen starter.The 32-year-old has been out of work ever since but received the call from his old team after news broke that Panthers starting quarterback Sam Darnold had suffered an incomplete fracture in his right scapula and would miss multiple weeks of action.During his nine seasons with the Panthers, he helped the team make the playoffs four times, reaching Super Bowl 50 in 2015.Although the Super Bowl ended in a heartbreaking defeat to the Denver Broncos, it was comfortably Newton\\'s best season in the league, with him being voted the NFL\\'s Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year.He has totaled 31,698 passing yards, 190 passing touchdowns, 5,398 rushing yards and 70 rushing scores with the Panthers, as well as holding franchise records for quarterback wins (68), passing yards (29,041), passing touchdowns (182) and rushing touchdowns (58).And despite only featuring very briefly against the Cardinals, Newton provided a huge boost to Carolina. Combined with superstar running back Christian McCaffrey -- who is working his way back from injury -- and a strong defense, the Panthers stymied the Cardinals, who were without MVP candidate Kyler Murray and All-Pro wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins.The win improves the team\\'s record to 5-5 for the season as they search for an all-important playoff berth.

Penalized with a points deduction and a back of the grid start in the final race of the season, he was unable to claim the title from Jorge Lorenzo. Even six years on, Rossi has not forgiven his younger rival.\"2015 was a very bad moment, maybe the worst moment of my career,\" he told CNN. \"All the season I had a great fight with Jorge Lorenzo, who was my teammate in Yamaha, and at the end unfortunately another rider decided that I don\\'t have to win the championship, so Marc M찼rquez decided that I don\\'t have to become world champion, for the 10th time.\"Dirt, danger and big, big air: Welcome to Red Bull ImaginationM찼rquez has always denied that he had any intention of scuppering Rossi\\'s title bid, but the Italian remains unconvinced, and hatchets remain unburied.\"From that moment, it was not the same. For me, it changed a lot the feeling that I have with MotoGP, and also it was very bad for MotoGP because it was not able to manage this situation, and from that moment we don\\'t have any relationship,\" Rossi continued. Asked by CNN if he had a message for the Catalan, he roared with laughter. \"No,\" he answered flatly, \"I don\\'t have a message.\"Rossi did not name M찼rquez in his list of major rivalries, picking instead three others from his illustrious career. \"I had great rivalries, I enjoy always a lot, I think the best ones are with Max Biaggi, with the 500 and in MotoGP, and also with [Casey] Stoner because he was very fast and was a great talent, and with Jorge Lorenzo. These three I enjoy a lot, sometimes I won, sometimes I lose, but it was always a great fight.\"Rossi finished a respectable 10th in the Valencia GP to close out his stunning MotoGP career.Rossi\\'s impact on MotoGP is impossible to quantify, in part because he has been an ever-present in the premier class since the MotoGP brand was created, in 2002. \"Imagine, that I was here in the first race of MotoGP because before the name was not MotoGP, so from the beginning of MotoGP, you have Valentino Rossi,\" the Italian laughed.Now, as the sport finally parts ways with its most celebrated competitor, Rossi sees a bright future ahead for it without him, not least with a new crop of Italian talent on the grid.A bright future\"For the future, we have a lot of very fast Italian riders that can fight for the championship, like [Pecco] Bagnaia, like [Francesco] Morbidelli, and I will cheer for them,\" he told CNN.In a career full of joyful moments and great successes, Rossi also harked back to one of MotoGP\\'s most tragic moments, the death of Marco Simoncelli during the Malaysia Grand Prix 10 years ago. He admitted that he often still thinks of his fallen compatriot.\"MotoGP lost a great rider, but I lost a great friend because we always trained together and we stay a lot together during the normal life,\" Rossi told CNN. \"The memory of Marco is still very light, not just for me, but for all the paddock because he was a very funny guy. It\\'s already 10 years, but it looks a lot less because a lot of times I dream about Marco, and it\\'s like sometimes we met.\"Fans came out in full force for the Italian legend in his last MotoGP appearance.The sense of occasion as Rossi finally took his place on the grid in Valencia was palpable, even if he was starting from the fourth row.

The young Italian was sporting a specially designed helmet for the race, emblazoned with the number 46, and the words \\'Che Spettacolo!\\', or \\'What a Show!\\'Perhaps fittingly, Bagnaia took that number across the line to victory, ahead of a historic first ever Ducati podium lockout, ensuring the Bologna outfit added the team title to the constructor\\'s title it had already clinched.\"It was incredible, incredible,\" Bagnaia told the official MotoGP channel after the race. \"The only way possible to celebrate [Rossi] was to win with his helmet, so there was Vale with me, on the top of the podium, so I\\'m so happy.\"A fan writes a thank you message to Rossi on a mural dedicated to him before the Valencia GP.Rossi held his 10th place, underscoring the fact that, even at 42, he can still more than hold his own in a premier class race.Close friend and Brazilian soccer legend Ronaldo waved the checkered flag as the Italian crossed the line. A swarm of fans and riders surrounded him under a cloud of yellow smoke after the flag, before he returned to a guard of honor in the packed and applauding paddock, eventually standing on the saddle of his Yamaha amid the throng to wave at his now former colleagues.Two new chaptersRossi will not be stepping away from racing just yet, however. \"I will race with cars next year, with GT cars in some endurance championships in Europe,\" he told CNN. \"And you have also a very good championship in America that is called IMSA, and maybe one time, I will come to race in the US.\"\"I always drive racing cars, because it\\'s my great passion.

The 22-year-old scored his fourth late as France booked its spot at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, with the win guaranteeing it top spot of Group D with one game remaining. Mbappe\\'s night of goals was a historic one in scoring for the French national team. His hat-trick was the first by a France player in a competitive international since Dominique Rocheteau in 1985.

Some of those are only babies or toddlers.The migrants -- most of whom are from the Middle East and Asia -- are seeking to cross illegally into Poland, and from there into other European countries, particularly Germany, in search of a better life.Razor wire erected by Poland along the border prevents the migrants camped out in the Belarusian forest from crossing.A lucky few have small tents; others have made rough shelters from the boughs and branches of the coniferous trees around them.

There\\'s barely enough to keep those already here alive -- and Belarusian state border officials estimated the number of people in the border region would increase to 5,000 within a week. As desperate people scrambled to get firewood, logs to sit on and other supplies from trucks bringing aid, armed Belarusian forces tried to push them back.

BLR authorities told you lies.

That has been the case for both the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers, who face off this Sunday at Lambeau Field. A split of Wilson and Rodgers.For the Seahawks, their star quarterback Russell Wilson has been absent since October 7 after suffering \"severe\" injuries to the middle finger of his throwing hand. However, after undergoing surgery the next day, Wilson was officially cleared to return to play on Monday after four weeks on the sideline, according to a statement from Wilson\\'s doctor, Dr. Steve Shin.

Rodgers to return, post-Covid controversyFor the Packers, they were without the NFL\\'s reigning Most Valuable Player, Aaron Rodgers, for Sunday\\'s 13-7 loss against the Kansas City Chiefs because the 37-year-old was in violation of Covid-19 protocols. Although Packers head coach Matt LaFleur had declined to comment on whether Rodgers had tested positive or had been vaccinated in a press conference, appearing on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on Friday, Rodgers said he had contracted Covid-19 and that he is unvaccinated against the virus.Having previously announced back in August that he was \"immunized,\" Rodgers went on to say on Friday that he was \"in the crosshairs of the woke mob right now\" over his vaccination status and that the media was on a \"witch hunt\" to find out which players were vaccinated.Rodgers said he did not get vaccinated because he has an allergy to an ingredient in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and was scared about the possible side effects from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.The 37-year-old\\'s handling of the situation has led to criticism directed at the star quarterback.Earlier this week, Rodgers reappeared on the show and took \"full responsibility\" for his earlier comments.\"I shared an opinion that is polarizing, I get it. I misled some people about my status,\" he said. \"And to anybody who felt misled by those comments, I take full responsibility for those comments.\"Rodgers looks to pass against the Arizona Cardinals at State Farm Stadium on October 28.\"I understand that this issue, in general, is very charging to a lot of people because we are talking about public health.

              " ' (CNN)Australia won its first T20 World Cup title after beating New Zealand by eight wickets in the final on Sunday. In what was an Oceanic clash, Australia looked to be cruising to the 173 target set by New Zealand -- a score bolstered by a blistering 85 by captain Kane Williamson -- with David Warner and Mitchell Marsh looking comfortable at the crease. However, a wicket to Warner gave New Zealand some renewed hope, but the bludgeoning power of Marsh helped propel Australia to its target. With New Zealand looking rattled and some excellent batting on display, Australia was able to comfortably claim its first title in cricket\\'s short format. After sprinting onto the field to celebrate with Glenn Maxwell, Marsh and the rest of his teammates, Australia all-rounder Marcus Stoinis praised the team\\'s mentality and spirit for getting them over the line. Read More\"The key is this group of boys, we actually love each other,\" he said. \"It is beautiful, I can\\'t wait to keep playing with this team. I\\'m so proud of them.\"You won\\'t find bigger supporters of Mitch Marsh than right here, apart from his family. We are so proud of him!\"Josh Hazlewood (middle) celebrates with teammates after dismissing New Zealand\\'s Daryl Mitchell during the T20 World Cup final.Making historyHaving won the toss and choosing to bowl, from the start of the final, it seemed like the smart decision from Australia captain Aaron Finch. Through a combination of good bowling and a tough pitch, New Zealand was restricted for runs, also losing the wicket of opening batsmen Daryl Mitchell for just 11. The turning point for New Zealand came when captain Williamson bwas dropped by fast bowler Josh Hazlewood on the boundary. At that point, he had scored 21 runs off 21 balls. After that, he exploded, reaching a 32-ball 50 and also hitting Mitchell Starc for 22 runs off a single over. However, in what proved to be a big over for Australia, Hazlewood claimed the wickets of Glenn Phillips and Williamson -- after a remarkable innings of 85 runs off of 48 balls. In the final few overs, Jimmy Neesham and Tim Seifert were able to guide New Zealand to a respectable 172 after their 20 overs, meaning Australia needed 173 to win its first T20 World Cup. Williamson plays a shot during the T20 World Cup final.In response, Australia had a nervy opening over, with Finch -- who got out on the first ball in the semifinal -- surviving an early leg-before-wicket appeal in the first over. But he didn\\'t survive much longer, with Trent Boult grabbing the wicket, his short ball being caught by Mitchell in the deep. Through a partnership between Warner and Marsh, Australia was able to rebuild, reaching 82-1 at the halfway stage, needing 91 to win. Warner reached an emphatic 51 off of just 34 balls with an emphatic six as Australia continued its progress to victory. With the result slipping away from them, Boult returned to the bowling attack and claimed the wicket of Warner to give the Black Caps a glimmer of hope. In the next over though, Marsh reached his own half century with his own big six, hitting the mark after 31 balls. And with Maxwell -- and also some wasteful New Zealand bowling -- Australia eased to the target to claim the momentous victory, with Marsh top scoring for them on 77 not out. Although New Zealand\\'s wait for a T20 World Cup title goes on, it is an iconic win for Australia who has had success in other formats of cricket, but claims the elusive title in the T20 edition. Australia\\'s players celebrate their win at the T20 World Cup.A key cog in Australia\\'s success was leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who was the team\\'s leading wicket-taker in the tournament.

Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"I just tried to use my strengths to the best of my ability. I knew the wickets were going to be low and I bowled at good times,\" Zampa said.\"We won the toss and bowled first, so it was probably a little bit drier when I was bowling and I tried to get wickets when we needed them.\"We\\'ve been in bubbles for almost two years now and that takes a toll on everyone, but you wouldn\\'t know it with our guys.\"',\n",

              " ' (CNN)The Miami Dolphins defense produced a sterling effort to stifle the Baltimore Ravens and help the Florida team claim a 22-10 upset victory on Thursday Night Football. Star cornerback Xavien Howard forced a fumble and returned it for a 49-yard touchdown to give the Dolphins a 15-3 lead early in the fourth quarter and Justin Coleman intercepted Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson late on to seal the win. Jackson was sacked four times at Hard Rock Stadium as the 24-year-old -- in what was a homecoming as he was born in Florida -- struggled for rhythm and accuracy. Justin Coleman celebrates with teammates after intercepting a pass from Jackson. A Mark Andrews touchdown with just over four minutes remaining in the fourth gave the visitors some hope. But quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who had come in to replace an injured Jacoby Brissett, scored a one-yard touchdown run late in the contest to put the result beyond doubt. Read MoreThe upset victory was the Dolphins\\' second straight win, lifting them to a 3-7 record and dropping the Ravens to 6-3. It was one of the worst offensive performances since 2019 NFL Most Valuable Player Jackson -- who threw the late interception with just 43 seconds remaining to wrap up the result -- took the reins of the team. He could be seen on the sideline displaying his anger at some of his teammates and, after the loss, admitted his frustrations. \"I was hot. Like, we weren\\'t scoring any points,\" he told the media. \"We were putting our defense out there. Jackson runs with the ball against the Miami Dolphins.\"I feel our defense played lights out, man. We just weren\\'t getting it done on offense, so that\\'s why I was mad. If you were on offense, you would be mad, too.\"Tagovailoa, the fifth overall pick in the 2020 draft, is the Dolphins starting quarterback, but has recently missed time due to a fracture in his middle finger. He was deemed healthy enough to start the game on the bench, but after Brissett was hurt on a sack by veteran Justin Houston on the Dolphins\\' opening drive of the second half, clutching his knee in pain, the 23-year-old was thrust back into action. Although Dolphins head coach Brian Flores said after the game that Brissett could have returned, the team chose to stick with the youngster.

Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told reporters on Friday that the government should give the \"green light\" for the move this weekend.\"The aim is clear: we want on Sunday to give the green light for a nationwide lockdown for the unvaccinated,\" Schallenberg said at a news conference in Innsbruck.He had earlier called the country\\'s vaccination rate \"shamefully low,\" and hinted that the measure would be triggered within days. \"In other states that rate is a lot higher -- it is shameful as we have enough vaccines available,\" Schallenberg said at a separate press conference on Thursday.His warning came as a wave of Covid-19 infections sweeps central Europe.

Youssef Atallah, a 37-year-old Syrian, arrived in Poland recently after his third attempt at crossing from Belarus. Speaking at a refugee center in Bia흢ystok, he recalled how upon arriving at the border, guards caught his group of four and he was beaten, leaving him with facial injuries, a broken nose and bruised ribs.  \"They took us to the forbidden area. That was the first try to cross the border to Poland,\" he told CNN. He said Belarusian officials refused to provide medical aid and repeatedly told them to head to Poland rather than return to Minsk.

Atallah said his memory of the journey is muddled because of his medical issues but he has been told he spent three days in the forest before he was picked up by Polish police and brought to the refugee center. While making the treacherous journey into Poland, Atallah said he had no food and drank water from a swamp. He added, \"I saw stuff left by another refugee group (and) I found a cube of sugar. I just start sucking on it because I can\\'t chew, I can\\'t bite or anything.\"He said his experience of the Polish guards and at the center has been starkly different to his treatment by Belarusian officers. \"They are very kind with us actually.

The doctors even gave me clothes.\"Despite the grueling journey, Atallah said he\\'d make the trip again for his family due to the perilous humanitarian situation back in Syria. Tense border standoffPolish authorities Wednesday posted two videos from the border that they claim shows Belarus troops firing into the ground and scuffling with people. Poland said the footage shows the tactics employed by the Belarusian services to intimidate migrants in their presence. CNN cannot verify that claim as the video is not clear enough to say what is happening -- but it is yet an example of the war of words which have escalated in the conflict. Anton Bychkovsky, the press secretary for the Belarusian State Border Committee, which is responsible for the country\\'s external borders, pushed back on the allegation, saying the video does not allow an objective assessment of the full picture. He described it as a likely provocation from the Polish side \"with the aim of further escalating the situation and diverting attention from its own actions in relation to refugees, as well as for manipulating public opinion.\"Freezing migrants huddle close to a bonfire at a tent camp on the border. Separate footage posted by Polish police to Twitter Wednesday showed rows of officers in riot gear with large protective shields lining parts of the border as helicopters monitor the situation from above. Aerial footage shows tents and smoke billowing from small campfires scattered along the Belarusian side of the barrier close to nearby forests. In other Polish footage shared overnight, soldiers remained in formation closely watching the fencing, occasionally raising torches to check any movement close by, their breath visible in the sub-zero temperatures. In multiple videos from Polish authorities earlier this week, migrants were seen desperately trying to breach the barriers with shovels, wire cutters and brute force. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia have seen a surge of people attempting to enter their countries from Belarus in recent months. Many of the migrants -- most of whom are from the Middle East and Asia -- are hoping to travel on from Poland deeper into Europe. Lithuania declared a state of emergency for a month, which went into effect at midnight on Wednesday. Meanwhile, video from Belarus state media showed children shouting \"Germany, Germany\" towards the barrier on Tuesday. In an attempt to deter migrants, the Polish government has been sending text messages to foreign cell phone numbers in the border area which read: \"The Polish border is sealed. BLR [Belarus] authorities told you lies. Go back to Minsk!\" It ends by warning migrants against taking pills from Belarusian soldiers -- referring to a claim from Polish officials that a migrant was given a tablet before falling ill and dying.The press officer for the Polish border guard, Katarzyna Zdanowicz, said the situation in the Kuznica area was calm on Wednesday and that migrants had received hot food and drinks from Belarusian servicemen overnight. Zdanowicz put the number of migrants camped out along the border at around 4,000, citing border guard estimates. She did not rule out the possibility that more people were making their way towards the border area from other parts of Belarus. However, the Belarusian State Border Committee said Tuesday there were around 2,000 migrants at the scene.Multiple Polish officials have accused Belarus of helping migrants in attempts to cross the border. Deputy Interior Minister Bartosz Grodecki told Polish media on Wednesday that migrants are \"constantly transported to the border by the Belarusian services.\"Grodecki also alleged that \"apart from the Belarusian services, there are probably also representatives of the Russian services\" among the crowds of migrants attempting to breach the border. The stand-off at the Poland-Belarus border continues, as concerns of potential violence intensify.Diplomatic blame gameAs the border row intensifies, the EU has said it is likely to impose further sanctions on Belarus, with the European Commission labeling it \"a gangster regime\" on Tuesday and criticizing Lukashenko over his \"false promises\" that it said lured migrants to the border believing they will gain \"easy entry into the EU.\" European Vice President Margaritis Schinas told CNN\\'s Becky Anderson Wednesday he was traveling to visit third countries where flights transporting migrants to Belarus are commencing, to ask \"for their cooperation in refraining from these tactics.\" He said he has also been in contact with third-country airlines involved in bringing migrants to Minsk.

In a press conference following talks between Russian and Belarusian foreign ministers in Moscow, Makei said that \"a large-scale complex aggression has been unleashed against Belarus,\" which cannot remain unanswered. Russian warplanes performed patrols over Belarus airspace on Wednesday. \"These are measures of adequate response to the evolving situation both in the air and on the ground,\" the Belarus Defense Ministry said on its Telegram channel. Joint flights with the two countries\\' air forces will be \"performed on a regular basis\" going forward, it added.The two long-range Russian Tu-22m3 bombers practiced \"issues of interaction with ground control points\" with armed forces of both countries, according to the Russian ministry of defense.

Migrants caught in the middleHumanitarian groups have previously criticized Poland\\'s nationalist government over its treatment of migrants at the border, where they face grueling conditions as temperatures plummet overnight and a lack of food and medical attention is available. Rights groups have also accused Polish authorities of multiple illegal pushbacks -- a claim border officials have rejected, arguing instead that they are acting in accordance with government regulations.Border Aid, a volunteer group of Polish medical workers, has not been allowed to treat migrants in the exclusion zone established by Poland\\'s state of emergency, and their repeated applications for entry have been denied, Kaja Filaczynska, a Polish medic working with the group told CNN. \"We get calls from people in the zone and we can\\'t answer them,\" Filaczynska said. Operating from a station a few hundred meters away from zone, Filaczynska said that the medics have been treating migrants, including pregnant women and children, for hypothermia, dehydration, hunger, food poisoning and traumas to the feet once seen in soldiers fighting in the trenches. \"It would be a few weeks ago unthinkable for me as a medical professional that in the 21st century there are children and women and pregnant women in the middle of the forest in Western civilization and that they are suffering because, not of the severe disease they have, but because of the cold, because they don\\'t have drinking water, and they don\\'t have food,\" she added.Save the Children Europe Director Anita Bay said the situation at the border was \"against EU laws and values\" and that states needed to ensure the safety of migrants and refugees stuck at makeshift camps in a statement on Tuesday. Temperatures often plummet overnight leaving migrants camped in the freezing cold with little access to food and water. \"Children stranded near the border with Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia since the end of August have been struggling with hypothermia, exhaustion, and hunger, while their mental and physical health have deteriorated from their perilous journeys and the drawn-out situation they\\'re facing,\" Bay said. \"We\\'ve seen footage of entire families pushed back to Belarus, and their request for international protection and immediate help ignored.\"Bay said it was \"unacceptable that the lives of children and their families are being used as a bargaining chip in a regional conflict\" before calling on the EU to provide access \"so they can request international protection.\" US State Department Spokesman Ned Price reiterated Washington\\'s support for Poland on Tuesday, saying \"The United States will continue to stand by Poland and all our partners in Europe who have been threatened by Belarus\\' unacceptable actions.\"Journalist Magda Chodownik reported from Sokolka, Poland while CNN\\'s Antonia Mortensen reported from Milan, Italy and Lauren Said-Moorhouse wrote from London.

              " ' (CNN)Golfers are getting a fair share of the sport\\'s revenue, according one of golf\\'s leading executives, Keith Pelley. Pelley was speaking following the announcement of the European Tour\\'s new sponsorship deal with DP World, a deal which Pelley believes will be \"game changing.\"Beginning in 2022, the tour will be rebranded to the DP World Tour, while also bringing in \"significant\" investment. According to the statement released by the European Tour on Tuesday, the new sponsorship deal will result in total prize money reaching over $200 million for the first time. There will also be a new minimum prize fund of $2 million for all tournaments solely sanctioned by the DP World Tour.Although the deal represents a new era of growth for the European Tour, according to Pelley, news of a lucrative, Saudi-backed global tour -- to be led by golf legend Greg Norman -- has raised questions about whether players could earn more outside of the traditional circuits: the European Tour and the PGA Tour. Read MoreThe new venture will reportedly offer eye-watering amounts of money to lure some of golf\\'s biggest names to compete against each other on a more regular basis. Speaking in May, six-time major winner Phil Mickelson said it might be something fans would be interested in. \"I think the fans would love it because they would see the best players play exponentially more times,\" Mickelson told ESPN. \"Instead of four or five times, it would be 20 times ... I don\\'t know what the final number is.Mickelson plays a shot on the eighth hole during the PGA Tour Champions Constellation FURYK & FRIENDS on October 8, 2021.\"But that\\'s a big deal to give up control of your schedule. I don\\'t know if the players would be selfless enough to do that. But every other sport, the entity or teams or leagues control the schedule. The players kind of play where they are told to play. Whereas here, we\\'re able to control it.\"Most sports in the US have collective bargaining, like the NBA, where the players get an almost 50-50 share of revenues with team owners. In comparison, golfers get a smaller share of broadcast money but major winner Justin Thomas doesn\\'t think they are unfairly compensated. \"Maybe in the past,\" Thomas said ahead of the Mayakoba Golf Classic earlier in November. \"But I think with stuff like the Player Impact Program and purses and everything going up, I think it\\'s becoming that way because it doesn\\'t matter what you do or what sport you play or whatever it is, there\\'s always going to be a handful or a group of guys that push the revenue or push the interest.\"The PGA Tour\\'s Player Impact Program (PIP) is designed to reward players who positively drive fan and sponsor engagement. It will award the top-10 most popular players based on a composite score of their media exposure from a reported fund of $40 million.Pelley -- who has vast experience working in North American sports with the Canadian Football League and the National Hockey League -- says that in his opinion, golfers get \"enough in terms of revenue share.\"\"The answer is our revenue share is significant and it is comparable, in my opinion, to the major sports in North America,\" Pelley continued. \"It would take me at least 60 minutes to explain to you that it is not an apples-to-apples comparison. So the answer to your question is emphatically yes, they do get enough in terms of revenue share.\"Pelley said that the announcement of the sponsorship with DP World isn\\'t a response to the announcement of the new Saudi-backed league, but rather the culmination of discussions that began in 2018.And including the word \\'world\\' in its title is a fitting decision given the Tour\\'s global schedule. Pelley in action during the Hero Pro Am prior to the start of the British Masters.Next year, it will feature a minimum of 47 tournaments across 27 countries -- 23 in Europe, 24 around the rest of the world -- including new tournaments in the UAE, Japan, South Africa and Belgium. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosBut while it will come with an increased prize fund, the deal is about more than that. \"The Challenge Tour (the European Tour\\'s feeder tour) is also going to get increased prize funding, increased playing opportunities, increased events,\" he explained. \"But also what we are going to do is invest money in other areas like physio and fitness and nutrition and such, which will allow the Challenge Tour players to be more ready when they\\'re on the DP World Tour.\"He added: \"We\\'re also going to support our charity \\'Golf for Good,\\' and we\\'re also going to invest into golfers with a disability, which is something that we believe strongly in terms of the inclusivity of the game. We this year had the European Disabled Golf Tour, four qualifying events, the final event will be next week at the DP World Tour. So this is a lot more than just about money for top players.\"',\n",

Migrants warm themselves by a bonfire in a camp on the Belarusian-Polish border on Wednesday. Thousands of stranded people between Poland and Belarus are caught at the center of an intensifying geopolitical dispute that has pitted the EU, the US and NATO against the Belarusian government. Western officials have accused Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko of manufacturing a migrant crisis on the EU\\'s eastern frontier to destabilize the bloc as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses. His government denies the claims, and instead blames the West for dangerous, sometimes fatal, border crossings and poor treatment of migrants. The Polish border guard said on Thursday that it had recorded around 1,000 crossing attempts in the last two days, including some \"large-scale\" efforts with groups of more than 100 people trying to breach the fence. Polish authorities have detained small numbers of people and immediately sent others back to Belarus.Polish authorities said that since the beginning of November, there have been 4,300 recorded border crossing attempts.

She recently partnered with Anthem, an insurance company that has conducted a study into the social drivers that affect people\\'s health in the US. The campaign hopes to trigger a national conversation about well-being and improve people\\'s awareness of the things in life that can have a negative impact on one\\'s health.  \"It\\'s been really interesting to me that there are these social drivers affecting our health and there are things that we don\\'t really necessarily associate with health,\" she told CNN Sport\\'s Amanda Davies.Read More\"So transportation and air quality and some of these things that you\\'re just born into.\"It\\'s really about taking a holistic approach to our health and, you know, figuring out how we spark conversations to create change for this.\" The study, called Driving our Health, also found racial discrepancies when it came to healthcare statistics, with people of color saying they were more negatively affected by social drivers of health.Felix wants to raise awareness in those communities, something she became passionate about after the birth of her daughter three years ago. In November 2018, the American struggled with preeclampsia and had an emergency C-section at 32 weeks to deliver her daughter. \"Obviously being an athlete and being healthy, living a healthy lifestyle, I never expected to find myself in that position,\" she added.\"And so to be there and to be, you know, so scared and really not feeling like I was educated about the circumstances, it\\'s really opened my eyes to kind of the whole new world of health.\"And really not taking my own health for granted and really wanting to raise awareness around some of these issues.\" Allyson Felix wants to help start conversations about health. Finding her voiceFelix says that becoming a mother helped her find her own voice, and she has been one of the many athletes to speak out against injustice in recent years, notably for women\\'s rights and for racial equality. She says she felt compelled to speak out after the death of George Floyd in 2020 and has continued to use her platform to fight for change.\"I think it can get frustrating sometimes, taking on some of the same issues,\" she said, adding that she was hopeful that she could continue to make a difference.\"But at the same time, I feel it\\'s such a privilege to be able to speak on behalf of others and to really try to fight and to push for certain things.\"It\\'s been a process to get to this point and I\\'ve really grown and come into my own. \"I think it was my own personal experiences that really allowed me to say: \\'No, I need to come forward and I need to speak on things that are affecting not only myself, but other women and other people within my community.\\'\" Felix won two more Olympic medals at Tokyo 2020.

She is particularly inspired by the likes of Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka, who both bucked the trend by addressing their mental health struggles this year.In many ways, Tokyo 2020 will be remembered as a cornerstone for athletes speaking openly about the pressures of competition and Felix says it\\'s about time.  \"I think for a long time, you know, athletes have just been seen as invincible, and we\\'re no different than anybody else and we go through struggles and challenges,\" she said, before explaining how she deals with the pressure. \"I think really making it a priority, making our mental health a priority and understanding when you\\'re not OK and what are the steps and what works for you.\"I know when I have to lean into my support system, when I need to step away.\"Kind of what helps me to be able to thrive and taking that time and taking that space for myself.\"JUST WATCHED\\'You have to train your brain as much as any muscle\\'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\\'You have to train your brain as much as any muscle\\' 02:47\\'A real representation for women\\'Felix, however, enjoyed yet more Olympic success in Japan.She added two medals to her haul -- including a gold in the women\\'s 400m sprint relay -- but such success didn\\'t always look likely. In addition to the complications of returning to the sport with a young daughter, Felix was also forced to adapt her training schedule, practicing on empty soccer fields and beaches during the initial stages of the pandemic in 2020.Her husband, Kenneth Ferguson, took leave from his job at Chrysler and the family moved to Los Angeles from Michigan so Felix could train with her coach, Bob Kersee, ahead of competition. Despite all the sacrifice, Felix says it was worth it.\"There were so many amazing moments, and I also felt like a real representation for women and for people who had been told that their journeys and their stories were over,\" she said about what will be her last Olympic Games. \"And so I knew that I would have mixed emotions.

In recent months, Kanter has used social media posts and specially designed clothing during NBA games to bring awareness to China\\'s treatment of the Uyghur community, Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong.  His posts and comments have caused a backlash in China with Celtics games being pulled by Chinese video-streaming site Tencent and the government criticizing the 29-year-old\\'s comments. Kanter told CNN\\'s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview that despite speaking out on issues such as Black Lives Matter, the NBA has stayed silent on China -- highlighting its struggle in balancing player activism with the lucrative Chinese market. \"NBA made me do this,\" Kanter said. \"Because every time when one of the NBA teams or the commissioner comes out to speak, they say we are encouraging players to talk about whatever they want to talk about.

They would have put out some kind of statement,\" he said. \"People think I do politics, I don\\'t do politics.

Kanter has also not seen his family since 2015 after he says Turkey canceled his passport.  Despite this, Kanter says he is determined to keep using his platform to fight for change and will continue educating himself about various human rights issues regarding China. The NBA is caught once again between free speech and the lucrative Chinese marketA lot of his criticism has been based around the injustice felt by the Uyghur community -- the US State Department estimates that up to two million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have been detained in internment camps in China\\'s Xinjiang province since 2017.  China has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region. \"There are so many athletes, so many actors, so many singers and so many people who have a platform that are speaking out about many of the issues out there in the world.\"But when it comes to China [...] they are scared because they care too much about money, they care too much about business and they care too much about endorsement deals. \"To me, the human rights, and saving people\\'s lives, comes first.\" Chinese officials have continued to discredit Kanter\\'s claims and sent a statement to CNN prior to his interview on Wednesday. \"The so-called \\'cultural genocide\\' in Tibet, human rights abuses in Xinjiang and \\'forced labor\\' in China are groundless accusations and complete lies,\" read a statement from the Chinese Embassy in London. It added: \"When it comes to the human rights situation in a country, it is the people of the country who are in the best position to make a judgment. \"Tibet and Xinjiang related issues are China\\'s internal affairs which brook no interference from outside forces.Kanter has also called on Nike to do more in fighting against injustice in China, particularly criticizing its silence over the treatment of the Uyghur community.He said the company was profiting from slave labor and called Nike athletes who speak out against other social justice issues \"hypocrites\" for not using their voice against China.Earlier this year, Nike released a statement saying it did not source products from the Xinjiang region. \"Nike is committed to ethical and responsible manufacturing and we uphold international labor standards,\" said the statement.\"We are concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).\"Nike does not source products from the XUAR and we have confirmed with our contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region.\"Nike was not immediately available for comment about Kanter\\'s latest comments when asked by CNN.China says the camps are vocational, aimed at combating terrorism and separatism, and has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses in the region.',\n",
              " 'London (CNN)In September, when the White House announced its long-awaited plan to welcome vaccinated European travelers, the United States was consumed by a Covid-19 surge that far outpaced Europe\\'s.At that point the US rate of new cases per capita dwarfed Europe\\'s by nearly three to one. While European governments were plotting their roadmaps towards normality, America was battling a rise in infections and warning of pressure on hospitals.But by Monday, when the new rules came into effect and thousands of tourists jetted across the Atlantic to American cities, the two regions had experienced a dramatic reversal in fortunes.Europe is now the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic once again; it overtook the US case count at the end of October and is now careering towards a difficult winter.Infections are rising in most of the countries that make up the Schengen area, the 26-country bloc where entry rules to the US have been relaxed. Travelers from the United Kingdom and Ireland were also included in the American policy shift.Read More\"We are at another critical point of pandemic resurgence,\" WHO regional director Hans Kluge said last week, warning that the pace of transmission across the region was of \"grave concern.\" \"According to one reliable projection, if we stay on this trajectory, we could see another half a million COVID-19 deaths in Europe and Central Asia by the first of February next year,\" Kluge warned, adding that 43 of the 53 countries on his patch could also see high or extreme stress on hospital beds.Europe\\'s current wave has not resulted in as high a death rate as the US\\' summer spike. But it serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of the pandemic, experts said. \"The situation across Europe was to be expected in some respects. We did anticipate there would be a surge in cases around this time of year,\" said Paul Wilmes, a professor at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine.And others note that the relative success of some highly vaccinated nations such as Spain and Portugal -- where cases have remained at manageable levels despite the general upward trends across the continent -- can serve as an example to governments in Europe and elsewhere.\"It\\'s happening in many countries, but it\\'s not inevitable,\" said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"We need to look at what is happening and which policies are giving rise to it ... there are things that can be done.\"Vaccination hurdlesThe US\\' vaccine rollout outpaced Europe\\'s in its early months, but the two regions crossed paths in the summer when the EU\\'s rate of new shots delivered overtook that of the US. Now attention is turning to unvaccinated pockets of both regions, as leaders struggle to kickstart their plateaued vaccine drives. US President Joe Biden has amplified his rhetoric towards unvaccinated people in recent weeks, telling reporters in the White House they \"can cause a lot of damage, and they are.\"\"The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, are overrunning the emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack, or pancreatitis, or cancer,\" the President said in September.People wait to be vaccinated in Berlin, as Germany grapples with a rise in cases.A handful of European governments are starting to mimic his bullish stance, as they grow frustrated with stalling rollouts and adopt a more direct approach towards those who are hesitant to get a shot.Germany\\'s Health Minister Jens Spahn said this month the country is experiencing a \"massive\" pandemic of the unvaccinated. \"The truth is that there would be far fewer Covid-19 patients in [intensive care] if everyone who could do it got a vaccination,\" he said.\"There is more and more recognition that those people who are unwilling to contribute to solving the challenges of the pandemic are placing other people at risk,\" McKee said. \"They are undermining the recovery for other people, and there is an increasing impatience\" towards them from politicians and the public, he added.But the two regions ultimately face relatable challenges.The vaccination rollout has slowed to a crawl in parts of the South and the Midwestern American states, with a strong correlation linking low vaccine levels to more heavily Republican and less college-educated states. Of the 15 US states with the lowest vaccination rates, all but one voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 election.In Europe, a different divide in vaccine uptake has become equally clear; countries in the west and north of the continent have posted high figures, led by Portugal and Spain on Europe\\'s Iberian peninsula where the share of the population that is fully vaccinated is 87% and 80% respectively. But towards the east, that trend moves sharply downwards.Romania and Bulgaria, which are not included in the Schengen travel area and therefore not included in the US\\' relaxed entry rules, have particularly struggled with administering doses. Slovakia, Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic have also failed to keep pace with their neighbors to the west, with all four countries vaccinating less than 60% of their population so far.\"This is not new -- we have seen this for other vaccines,\" said Wilmes. \"In some countries you see inherent levels of conformity to go along with vaccination campaigns, compared to others.\"\"We know that vaccination has an impact on transmission -- the more people vaccinated within a population, the more you can limit transmission,\" he added. But he noted that waning immunity has become a \"clear reality\" and has posed an additional challenge to governments.\\'Cultural differences\\'The other major plank of the American approach has been on face masks; Biden made face coverings mandatory on federal property during his first day in office, and has since urged states to ensure their use in schools, offices and elsewhere.But the mask has become a symbol of a divided society in the US, and partisan leanings factor strongly into how frequently they are used.Europe has avoided that divide, experts say. \"People do not perceive mask wearing as an infringement on personal liberties the way that some parts of the US do. There\\'s definitely a cultural difference,\" said Wilmes. Some highly vaccinated countries, such as Portugal and Spain, have been cautious in easing rules on mask wearing and still require them in certain settings. But nations like the UK and Denmark have revoked rules altogether, leaving the decision up to citizens -- in the UK, the use of masks has noticeably dropped off since.Rules on travel in Europe have eased in recent months, and many countries have dialed back restrictions on gatherings -- leading to concerns on the continent that the new surge in cases may be accompanied by a return of measures.\"The countries that have relaxed measures did so at times when the case numbers were low, and against the backdrop of many people being vaccinated,\" Wilmes said. \"We don\\'t have crystal balls -- it\\'s a hard judgment call that governments have to make.\"Many European countries, such as France, Italy and Germany, have meanwhile embraced vaccine passports, with the EU\\'s digital certificate system, and some national equivalents, used to approve entry to bars, clubs and restaurants.The safeguards have presented \"an important measure in trying to limit transmission,\" Wilmes said.Lufthansa crew members before a flight from Munich, Germany to Miami, as European travelers celebrate the reopening of US borders.\"Vaccine passports have been helpful both in limiting unvaccinated people from mixing together, but also encouraging people to get vaccinated,\" added McKee.The US has not followed suit on the EU\\'s system, but Biden has pushed ahead with plans to implement a vaccine requirement for certain companies and fields. His administration announced last week that its vaccine rules, which apply to private businesses with 100 or more employees, certain health care workers and federal contractors, will take effect January 4.\"Vaccination is the single best pathway out of this pandemic,\" Biden said in a statement. \"And while I would have much preferred that requirements not become necessary, too many people remain unvaccinated for us to get out of this pandemic for good. So I instituted requirements -- and they are working.\"',\n",

Pistorius killed Steenkamp at his home in an upscale Pretoria neighborhood in the early hours of February 14, 2013 -- a killing he says was an accident after he mistook her for an intruder, but one the prosecution called a deliberate act after the two had an argument.Pistorius was originally convicted of manslaughter in 2014 after months of hearings and sentenced to five years, but a higher court overturned the conviction and changed it to murder a year later.Read MoreThe judge described Pistorius as a \"fallen hero\" who will never be at peace and sentenced him to six years in prison.However, in 2017, a South African high court more than doubled Pistorius\\' sentence for Steenkamp\\'s killing.Pistorius\\' sentence more than doubled; slain girlfriend\\'s family calls it \\'justice\\'The Supreme Court of Appeal increased his sentence to 13 years and five months for the murder of Steenkamp.

I just think that that was incredibly inappropriate.\"I think that one was just bad timing. It\\'s pretty clear to everybody who saw it that I wasn\\'t taunting.\"I\\'ve been doing the celebration my whole career. It\\'s just sad to see stuff like that happen in a close game like that.\"Roethlisberger dives for the first down past Trevis Gipson during the fourth quarter.Corrente spoke to a pool reporter after the game to explain his decisions. \"First of all, keep in mind that taunting is a point of emphasis this year,\" Corrente said.\"And with that said, I saw the player, after he made a big play, run towards the bench area of the Pittsburgh Steelers and posture in such a way that I felt he was taunting them.\"On the alleged contact with Marsh, Corrente said: \"That had nothing to do with it. It was the taunting aspect.\"On the subject of sacks, Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt dazzled on the defensive side with seven tackles and three sacks -- his second of the game on Fields taking him to an incredible 60 career sacks in just 69 games, the fourth fastest player in history to reach this milestone. Only Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett has more sacks than Watt\\'s 11.5 this season, with 12.Rise and slideThe result continues the respective rise and slide of both teams. Having gone 0-3 in Weeks 2-4, Monday\\'s victory extends the Steelers\\' streak following wins over the Denver Broncos, the Seattle Seahawks and the Cleveland Browns.Meanwhile, the Bears drop to 3-6 with a fourth successive defeat, but they will take heart from the manner in which they lost -- a stark contrast to the 38-3 thrashing at the hands of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last month -- and the electric fourth quarter performance of Fields.The 22-year-old threw for 291 yards overall -- a personal best for the season -- and a touchdown pass to Darnell Mooney to rally his team in the fourth, a display that did not go unnoticed by Bears head coach Matt Nagy.\"The big picture, for him, is great,\" Nagy said, discussing the drive. Fields carries the ball during the third quarter.\"When they kicked that field goal and went up six, there was a really, pretty neat moment on the sideline. You can feel it from the players, like, \\'OK, we fought back to get to this point where a touchdown wins it.\\' \"Then I looked over at Justin, and he had this smile on his face where it was like, it was his time. To see that, the confidence that gives you as a coach when you see that -- it was like he was almost hoping that this was going to be the situation. \"Then for him to follow through with that and make those plays that he made, it was a really, really good feeling on that sideline. So when you talk about the growth for him and for the offense and just our team in general, that\\'s a moment.\"',\n",
              " ' (CNN)Thousands of migrants have set up makeshift camps in freezing conditions near the border between Poland and Belarus, as condemnation of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko intensified Tuesday.Poland has accused Lukashenko of attempting to orchestrate a crisis on the European Union\\'s eastern frontier by funneling migrants to the border in retaliation for sweeping sanctions imposed on Minsk by the bloc and other Western powers in June. Lukashenko\\'s government has repeatedly denied the claims, blaming the West for dangerous, sometimes fatal, border crossings and poor treatment of migrants.International criticism of Belarus escalated on Tuesday, as the European Commission accused it of acting like \"a gangster regime\" and criticizing Lukashenko\\'s \"false promises\" that have tricked migrants into believing they will gain \"easy entry into the EU.\"The diplomatic drama comes a day after ugly scenes on Monday, when groups of migrants attempted to breach the border, some of whom who were pushed toward the barriers by Belarusian services, according to the Polish border guard. The head of the Polish Ministry of Defence Mariusz B흢aszczak later cast the attempted fence crossing as an \"attack,\" which he predicted would \"certainly be repeated.\" Belarus floods the European Union with migrants, taking a page out of Putin\\'s playbookRead MorePolish authorities on Tuesday morning closed the Kuznica border crossing -- where huge numbers of migrants were seen congregating the day before. Some 4,500 migrants are currently at the border near Kuznica trying to cross into Poland from Belarus, Polish border guard press officer Ewelina Szczepa흦ska told CNN. The Belarusian State Border Committee -- which is responsible for the country\\'s external borders -- said in a statement that there are around 2,000 migrants at the scene.Around 14,000 Polish soldiers, police and border guards are now stationed in the area, sparking fears of a major confrontation as migrants attempt to cross into Poland. The situation on the ground appeared calm on Tuesday, according to Juergen Weichert, a journalist working for CNN German affiliate n-tv in Kuznica. Weichert reported that Polish police were trying to clear the area as much as possible, and that migrants on the Belarusian side of the fence were still trying to get through the barbed wire north and south of the closed Kuznica crossing.Footage provided by the Belarus State Border Committee showed migrants wrapped in coats and hoodies huddled around small campfires, with aerial shots showing camps dotted along the Belarusian side of the border close to nearby forests. The video also showed the movement of what appeared to be military vehicles on the Polish side.Temperatures dropped below zero overnight Tuesday as migrants camped out on the border of Belarus with Poland. \\'Hybrid attack\\'Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki warned Tuesday that the situation was putting the security of the entire European Union at risk and again blamed Belarus for manufacturing a \"hybrid attack.\" \"Sealing the Polish border is our national interest. But today the stability and security of the entire EU is at stake,\" said Morawiecki, who visited soldiers at the border on Tuesday.\"This hybrid attack of Lukashenko\\'s regime is aimed at all of us. We will not be intimidated and will defend peace in Europe with our partners from NATO and EU,\" he added. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, is set to fly to Poland on Wednesday to meet with Morawiecki, according to Michel\\'s official schedule, made available on the European Council website on Tuesday.On Monday, Szczepa흦ska said groups of migrants had been attempting to force their way across the border. The Polish defense ministry also tweeted Monday that there had been a mass attempt to cross and that migrants had set up a camp that was \"constantly guarded by the Belarusian services.\" In multiple videos from Polish authorities, hundreds of migrants could be seen walking towards the border. In one clip, some were shown trying to breach a fence using shovels, wire cutters and brute force.Poland, Lithuania and Latvia have seen a surge of people attempting to cross into their countries from Belarus in recent months. The Polish border guard recorded 309 attempts to make illegal crossings Monday and 17 people were detained, Szczepa흦ska added. Poland has stopped over 32,000 attempts to cross the border since September, from migrants mainly from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, she said.On Monday, Polish officials said it had mobilized thousands of additional military personnel in response to the influx of migrants. Lithuania declared a one-month state of emergency on Tuesday in a 5 kilometer (3 mile) swathe of land running along its entire border with Belarus, where special services will be allowed to randomly search vehicles and people, public broadcaster LRT Lithuania reported. The state of emergency will also apply to refugee registration and detention centers, and a 200 meters radius around them, according to LRT Lithuania.Poland said Monday that hundreds of migrants in Belarus were descending on its border aiming to force their way into the EU member in what NATO slammed as a deliberate tactic by Minsk. Many of the migrants at the border are hoping to travel onwards from Poland deeper into western Europe. In Germany, federal police said in a statement it had registered 595 illegal entries on the Brandenburg state border with Poland in November alone. Brandenburg state borders most of the German-Polish frontier.  German authorities added that they had registered 4,890 entries with a Belarus connection so far this year. On Tuesday, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said EU nations needed \"to stick together\" and help the Polish government secure its borders. \"The Polish are rendering an important service to the European Union,\" Seehofer added.Dispute at the border escalatesThe European Commission said Tuesday that the EU will likely impose further sanctions against Belarus for encouraging people to cross illegally into Poland. In its daily briefing, the Commission\\'s lead spokesperson on foreign affairs, Peter Stano, said discussion was ongoing between member states regarding further sanctions which are \"on the way.\"Migrants carry their belongings as they make their way towards the Poland-Belarus border on Monday. The spokesman stressed that Lukashenko\\'s \"irrational and irresponsible behavior\" is a sign that he \"feels the pressure\" mounting from the EU\\'s deployment of sanctions. \"And why do we have a reason to believe that the sanctions are biting? Because the Lukashenko regime starts to behave as a gangster regime because it\\'s hurting them, and they don\\'t know what else to do. So, they try to undermine the European Union by attacking and launching a hybrid attack against the member states of the European Union.\"Meanwhile, a NATO alliance official warned it \"stands ready\" to come to the aid of its allies and called on Belarus to \"abide by international law.\"The official added: \"The Lukashenko regime\\'s use of migrants as a hybrid tactic is unacceptable. The Secretary General remains in close touch with Allied governments on the issue.\"NATO\\'s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also described Minsk\\'s actions as \"unacceptable,\" and said he has spoken with Polish President Andrzej Duda about the situation.Polish police officers stand guard at an area by the border on Monday.Concern grows for migrants Amid the international criticism, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday warned Poland against provocations \"directed against the Republic of Belarus to justify possible illegal forceful actions against disadvantaged unarmed people, among whom there are many underage children and women.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko \"exchanged views on the situation with refugees\" at Belarus\\' borders, according to a Kremlin statement Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Belarusian State Border Committee said in a statement Tuesday that Poland had lined up military equipment on the border. Polish army vehicles are parked along the barbed wire near the Kuznica border crossing on Tuesday. \"At the moment, a chain of Polish security forces has lined up in front of the refugee camp, equipment has been pulled together, including combat vehicles. Representatives of the media, international human rights and humanitarian organizations are not allowed to the border line from Poland to provide assistance to people seeking to apply for refugee status in the EU,\" the statement said. The committee claimed some of the refugees felt unwell after the Polish side deployed tear gas followed by loudspeakers and strobe lights against them overnight. It also said there were a \\'significant number\\' of pregnant women and babies among the migrants at the border UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said in a Tuesday briefing in Geneva that it was \"very alarmed by the scenes that we are seeing from the Belarus-Poland border.\"Military police conduct checks on vehicles near the border on Monday night. \"We have repeatedly said that using refugees, asylum seekers and migrants to achieve political ends is unacceptable and must stop,\" Mantoo added.Humanitarian groups have previously criticized Poland\\'s nationalist government over its treatment of migrants at the border, where they face grueling conditions as temperatures plummet overnight and a lack of food and medical attention is available. Rights groups have also accused Polish authorities of multiple illegal pushbacks -- a claim border officials have rejected, arguing instead that they are acting in accordance with government regulations. At least seven migrants have been found dead on Poland\\'s side of the border, with reports of more deaths in Belarus, according to Reuters.

              " ' (CNN)When the Czech Republic\\'s 200 newly-elected deputies gathered for the inaugural session of its new parliament on Monday, there wasn\\'t a single Communist party member there -- for the first time in 76 years.  The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), the direct successor of the totalitarian Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, has dropped out of the lower house of the Czech parliament after failing to gain any seats in last month\\'s election. The party lost its last seat in the upper house, the Senate, in 2018.The final departure of the Communists from the top levels of Czech politics marks a hugely symbolic moment for many survivors of the totalitarian regime, especially after the outgoing government of Prime Minister Andrej Babis breached a long-standing taboo and relied on the votes of the Communists in the parliament to secure a majority in 2018, giving them indirect access to power. While the party has attempted to re-brand itself as a modern and democratic leftist group in recent years, it never fully removed its association with the acts of its totalitarian predecessor. OPINION: This country\\'s election may be the strategy to defeat TrumpismMarek Benda -- of the Civic Democratic Party and the country\\'s longest serving Member of Parliament -- said he never expected the Communists to stay in parliament for so long after the revolution. Read More\"We thought that they would still have some voters, but that these would gradually disappear ... but they were doing quite well for much longer,\" Benda said.  Jan Rovny, an associate professor at Sciences Po in Paris, said the decline of the party is down mostly to the \"demographic replacement of its elder voters, nostalgic for communist regime certainties.\" But, writing in a policy blog, Rovny said the rise of populist parties like Babis\\' ANO and the far-right SPD have also contributed to the Communists\\' downfall.\"From its heyday at the helm of the authoritarian regime, the KSCM has been reduced to a radical left protest party in the post-1989 democracy,\" he wrote. \"The recent rise of cultural themes, centering on fears of migration advanced by the SPD and increasingly by ANO, has changed the substance of protest politics. The party\\'s core districts in the post-industrial northern regions have shifted allegiance.\"Katerina Konecna, the new KSCM leader, says she wants to attract the support of younger voters.KSCM\\'s leadership resigned following the party\\'s election defeat. Jiri Dolejs, a member of the KSCM board, told CNN that the party\\'s demise reflects a wider downfall of the left in Europe, pointing to other groups that have suffered losses, such as Germany\\'s Die Linke.\"The left has been competing with populists, migration and health crises have pushed away the traditional competition between the left and the right,\" he said. Vojtech Filip, the outgoing former KSCM leader, told Halo Noviny, a Czech leftist newspaper closely tied to the party: \"It is a great disappointment. The [election] debacle of the KSCM means that for the first time in modern history, the Communist Party will not be part of parliamentary democracy in the Czech Republic. The communists now face the task of doing everything in their power to regain prominence,\" The group\\'s newly-installed leader, Katerina Konecna, said her priority would be working to gain more support among younger people. According to the party\\'s official newspaper, the average age of KSCM members is now 75. \\'Very much stuck in the old ways\\'Benda was one of the student leaders of the 1989 revolution and entered parliament shortly after the fall of the communist regime. \"When I first entered the parliament, there were 70 of us new deputies and 130 of the old guys,\" he told CNN.  \"It was quite extreme, some of the old members were the real, old-school comrades. Of course the worst people were thrown out, but those that remained were still very much stuck in the old ways.\"He said that as a 21-year-old, he was addressed in an informal way by many of the old-school Communists, something he said he \"just couldn\\'t get used to.\"Benda said he sees the final exit of KSCM from the Czech parliament as a \"huge success.\" \"Especially because it happened in a democratic way, they fizzled out on their own,\" he added. The MP said there was no appetite for the party to be banned after the revolution: \"The atmosphere was not one of revenge and the West was also not supportive of the idea of making the party illegal.\"While it took 32 years for KSCM to drop out of parliament, the group\\'s final exit is more symbolic coming in 2021, a century after the original Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was formed.

Cavallo, who plays for Adelaide United in Australia\\'s A-League, received widespread support from the football community and beyond when he announced on social media that he is gay, including from Barcelona defender Gerard Piqu챕, Atl챕tico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann and Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson. The 21-year-old has now voiced his concerns about next year\\'s World Cup in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison.Does the footballing world really care about kicking homophobia out?\"It does sadden me to see that,\" Cavallo told the Guardian\\'s Today in Focus podcast. \"I read something along the lines of it gives a death penalty for gay people in Qatar. It\\'s something that I\\'m very scared (of) and wouldn\\'t really want to go to Qatar for that.\"He added: \"One of the greatest achievements as a professional footballer is to play for your country and to know that [the World Cup] is in a country that doesn\\'t support gay people and puts us at risk of our own life, that does scare me and that does me make re-evaluate.

In his interview with the Guardian, Cavallo reflected about the anguish he suffered before taking the decision to speak publicly about his sexuality.\"Not having anyone to look up to and to see okay, they\\'re playing football and they\\'re gay and they\\'re having a successful career -- that is something that scared me and something that I was worried that if I was to potentially come out one day, would it affect my career in a bad way?\" he said.\"It was only when I was by myself that I could genuinely relax and not worry and not stress [...] living in that constant fear and doubt that you could be questioned, or your lies just don\\'t add up.

              " ' (CNN)A silent killer is spreading through Australia\\'s koala population, posing a threat that wildlife experts say could wipe out the iconic marsupial across large parts of the country.The culprit is chlamydia, a sexually transmitted bacteria that infects more than 100 million people worldwide annually and can cause infertility in humans if left untreated.For koalas, uncontrolled chlamydia can cause blindness and painful cysts in a animal\\'s reproductive tract that may lead to infertility or even death. Worse still, antibiotics used to treat the disease can destroy the delicate gut flora koalas need to consume their staple diet of eucalyptus leaves, leading some to starve to death even after being cured.The disease can also spread quickly. Read MoreIn 2008, there was a \"very, very low chlamydial prevalence\" -- about 10% -- in the koala population in Gunnedah, a rural town in northeast New South Wales, according to Mark Krockenberger, a professor of veterinary pathology at the University of Sydney. By 2015, that figure had risen to as high as 60%. Now, about 85% of that koala population is infected with the disease, Krockenberger said.\"If you think about it, that\\'s not a viable population anymore because of infertility. Pretty much every female that\\'s infected with chlamydia becomes infertile within a year, maybe two years maximum ... Even if they survive, they\\'re not breeding,\" he said.Experts say situations like that in Gunnedah are playing out among koala populations across Australia, threatening populations already vulnerable to worsening bushfires and habitat loss due to deforestation.Scientists are now trialing vaccines against chlamydia to protect the animals.\"We run a very high risk, if this vaccine strategy doesn\\'t work ... of localized extinctions,\" Krockenberger said.Are koalas endangered in Australia?There are few more emblematic Australian animals than the koala. The gray, fluffy-eared marsupial, which eats leaves from the eucalyptus tree and carries its young in its pouch, can only be found in Australia and is regularly seen in cultural representations of the country.But koalas face a number of threats to their survival. Apart from disease, the marsupials suffer habitat loss and are often attacked by wild dogs and hit by cars.The koala is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\\'s (IUCN) Red List, which catalogs species at risk of extinction. The IUCN says there are between 100,000 and half a million koalas in the wild, but the Australian Koala Foundation says the number is closer to 58,000. Confusion about the size of Australia\\'s koala population inspired the government to commit 2 million Australian dollars ($1.47 million) last year to a national koala census to work out where they are and how many are left.The country\\'s koala population suffered severe losses during the catastrophic bushfires of 2019, which destroyed more than 12 million acres (48,000 squares kilometers) of land across New South Wales alone.The fires killed or displaced nearly 3 billion animals, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). That figure includes more than 60,000 koalas that either died, lost their habitat or suffered injury, trauma, smoke inhalation and heat stress from the flames.A koala named Paul from Lake Innes Nature Reserve recovers from his burns in the ICU at The Port Macquarie Koala Hospital on November 29, 2019, in Port Macquarie, Australia.In mid-2021, an Australian government report on the conservation status of koalas recommended the animal\\'s status be changed to \"endangered\" in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, as a result of the rapid population decline in those areas. In some regions, the report found populations had almost halved over just 20 years.The Australian government is drafting a National Recovery Plan for the Koala which will be reviewed in December 2021 before potentially becoming law in 2022. But Deborah Tabart, chairman of the Australian Koala Foundation, says much more needs to be done to protect koalas and their habitat across the entire country, warning the marsupials could be wiped out within three generations. \"We want a Koala Protection Act,\" she said. \"If you really are serious about protecting this species you would have legislation that is effective and that means protecting the trees,\" she said.Campaigners say it would be akin to the Bald Eagle Act in the United States that protects the country\\'s national emblem from threats to its population and habitat. How does chlamydia spread?When faced with the threats to the koala\\'s habitat and food supply, chlamydia might seem like a secondary issue. But with numbers dwindling, experts said reproduction has never been more important.There are two varieties of chlamydia in Australian koalas, one of which, chlamydia pecorum, is almost entirely responsible for the most severe cases of the disease in the population. A paper published in September 2020 in FEMS Microbiology Reviews said the more dangerous strain of chlamydia may have originated in domestic livestock brought to Australia by European colonizers in the 19th century.The disease spreads in koala populations through reproduction and social behavior connected to mating, though joeys -- baby koalas -- can catch the disease from their mothers.According to the University of Sydney, infection rates in some populations of mainland koalas in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria can be as high as 100%, rendering them entirely infertile.Highlighting the disease\\'s lethal potential, a study in the Journal of Applied Ecology in March 2018 found that of 291 koalas examined over four years, 18% had died of chlamydia or related complications.  Disease was the second highest cause of death, after animal attacks.Climate change is making the problem worseThe climate crisis has made Australia more vulnerable to devastating bushfires, such as those seen in 2019, as well as drought and heatwaves. It\\'s also making koalas more susceptible to disease.According to Australia\\'s leading scientific body, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the country has already warmed by about 1.44 degrees on average since 1910.The Australian government report said when the marsupials are exposed to unusually stressful environmental conditions, including \"hot weather, drought, habitat loss and fragmentation,\" chlamydia spreads more quickly through their population.A sign warning motorists about koalas stands in front of burned bushland near the town of Bilpin, New South Wales, Australia, on Sunday, December 29, 2019.Experts say they have witnessed similar rapid explosions of disease in the wild. Krockenberger said in his Gunnedah sample population, a series of heatwaves and droughts in 2009 and 2010 preceded a doubling of chlamydia cases.Peter Timms, professor of microbiology at University of Sunshine Coast in Australia, said once koalas\\' stress hormones rise due to environmental problems, infections often progress from a relatively minor problem to \"one that is more serious.\"He said a combination of habitat loss and climate change is causing koalas to be \"chronically stressed,\" depressing their immune systems.\"All that leads to poor chlamydia response. It gets them from low grade chlamydia infections to more serious disease,\" he said.\"That\\'s what we\\'re doing to them. And we\\'re doing it on all fronts.\"JUST WATCHEDFires threaten koalas in New South WalesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFires threaten koalas in New South Wales 02:22Chlamydia vaccine trials for koalasBut help could be on the way for Australia\\'s koalas.A chlamydia vaccine, developed by researcher Timms over the past decade, is being tested among the country\\'s koala population as a way to protect the animals from serious infections.Control trials are ongoing to test the effectiveness of the vaccine on small groups of koalas -- often about 20 or 30 at a time, Timms said. The current trial is the largest yet, involving 400 koalas.Some koalas are vaccinated when they are brought to veterinary hospitals with complaints other than chlamydia, while others are given the shot as part of coexisting conservation efforts, he added.\"We know the vaccine can reduce the infection rate,\" Timms said. \"It doesn\\'t reduce it to zero. There are no vaccines that do that, but it quashes the infection load way down.\"He said while it is hoped the process will reduce the infection rate, it is hard to monitor the spread of chlamydia in a wild population.A koala is vaccinated against chlamydia at the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland, Australia, on October 15.University of Sydney\\'s Krockenberger, who is involved in a separate vaccine trial, said the purpose of the drug isn\\'t to reverse the progress of the disease in individual koalas. \"Once they\\'re chronically infected, they\\'re often able to live reasonably happily, they just can\\'t breed,\" he said.He said instead the hope is that by reducing the levels of infectiousness in koalas with chlamydia, researchers will be able to prevent the disease from spreading to new hosts and thereby maintain a breeding population.\"We also hope that the unaffected animals, when they\\'re vaccinated, are more resistant to picking up the infection,\" he said.Timms said once the vaccine is proved to be safe and effective, he hopes to roll it out to wildlife hospitals around Australia to vaccinate any koalas who come through their doors.He said that people often ask him how he is going to vaccinate \"the last koala in the last tree\" for chlamydia, to which Timms responds he\\'s \"not even going to try.\" All he can do is try to save as much of the population as possible.After all, \"these are wild animals,\" he said.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to chlamydia as virus. It is caused by bacteria. ',\n",

Earlier this month, Championship club Swansea City and players from Scottish Premiership club Rangers boycotted social media for a week after their stars were targeted online. Former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry also announced he would come off his accounts until social media companies did more to stop online abuse.Speaking to CNN Sport, Henry said social media was \"not a safe place and it\\'s not a safe environment.\" He continued: \"I wanted to take a stand on saying that it is an important tool that unfortunately some people turn into a weapon because they can hide behind a fake account.\" READ: UEFA bans Slavia Prague\\'s Ond힂ej K첬dela for 10 games for racist behaviorJUST WATCHEDRacist social media abuse continues to plague UK footballReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRacist social media abuse continues to plague UK football 02:10\\'About time\\'The announcement by English football has been welcomed by players, with Sheffield United striker David McGoldrick telling Sky Sports that it was \"about time\" more was done.

              " 'Paris (CNN)A Paris court has found France legally responsible for its failure to meet targets intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The lawsuit was launched by four NGOs, including Greenpeace France and Oxfam France, following an online petition that gathered 2.3 million signatures -- the largest in French history, according to organizers.Signatories hoped to \"compel the State to take all necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\" to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target set by the Paris Agreement, according to the online petition.Oil companies are facing the moment of truth. The stakes couldn\\'t be higherThe Paris Agreement was signed by almost all the world\\'s countries, and seeks to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).France, which brokered the pact, has committed to reducing greenhouse gases by 40% by 2030, and has set itself a target of being carbon neutral by 2050.Read MoreBut NGOs accused the country\\'s authorities of insufficient policy actions needed to tackle climate change, and said that greenhouse gas emissions under the current government \"dropped at a pace that was twice as slow as the trajectories foreseen under the law.\" Activists brought a landmark case accusing the French state of inaction on climate change.Paris\\' administrative court on Wednesday ordered the state to pay one euro ($1.20) for moral damage to each of the associations behind the lawsuit, ruling that government failures \"undermined the collective interests defended by each of the applicant associations,\" the court said in its official communiqu챕 on the case.Despite only symbolic damages being awarded, the charities hailed the result.\"This decision marks a first historic victory for the climate and a major advance in French law. This judgment also marks a victory for the truth: Until now, the state has denied that its climate policies were insufficient, despite mounting evidence,\" they said in a statement.\"This is the first recognition by the courts of the responsibility of the French State for its climate inaction,\" Clementine Baldon, a lawyer for one of the NGOs, said at a press conference following the ruling.\"The judges examined whether there was a causal link between this ecological damage and the various breaches alleged against the state in the fight against climate change. They held that the state should be held responsible for part of this damage if it failed to meet its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" the court statement read.John Kerry says current goals under Paris climate agreement \\'inadequate\\' to reduce Earth\\'s temperatureIn order to determine the measures to be ordered to the state to repair the damage caused or prevent its aggravation, the judges issued a further investigation, with a two-month deadline.In a response to the ruling emailed to CNN, France\\'s environment ministry conceded \"that the first objectives set over this past period have indeed not been achieved,\" but said a new \"Climate and Resilience bill will be presented to the Council of Ministers on February 10 and will constitute a decisive new step by accelerating France\\'s ecological transition.\"Currently, the world is set to warm by 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.86 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) -- a non-profit analysis group which tracks government climate action. This will bring more extreme storms, heatwaves, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes.In 2019, the UN warned that to hold global warming below the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, global emissions would need to fall by 7.6% each year from 2020 to 2030.Global average temperatures have continued to climb. The last six years were the hottest six ever recorded, with 2020 joining 2016 as the hottest year.Pierre Bairin reported from Paris, Amy Woodyatt wrote from London.

              "' (CNN)Right now, there\\'s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world\\'s largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen\\'s trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we\\'re testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn\\'t touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple\\'s president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn\\'t need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple\\'s trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won\\'t be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company\\'s own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple\\'s trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation\\'s trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that\\'s still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you\\'re adding five cents per mile. But you\\'re saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic \\'Ironhand\\' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn\\'t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that\\'s not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple\\'s autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that\\'s a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it\\'s more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don\\'t want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone. Photos: The robots running our warehouses Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require. Scroll through to see more robots that are revolutionizing warehouses.Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesIn response to the coronavirus pandemic, MIT collaborated with Ava Robotics and the Greater Boston Food Bank to design a robot that can use UV light to sanitize the floor of a 4,000-square foot warehouse in just 30 minutes.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They\\'re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn\\'t get tired, doesn\\'t watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn\\'t get distracted.\" '"
