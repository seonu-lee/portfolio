The iPhone 17 is easing Wall Street’s concerns about Apple’s AI troubles,"As Big Techbattles for dominance in artificial intelligence, Apple is flying high on the success of the iPhone. The company reported earnings that blew past Wall Street’s expectations on Thursday, largely driven by the iPhone 17. Revenue hit $143.8 billionfor the quarter, up from $124.3 billion a year ago. Meanwhile,iPhone revenue reached $85.3 billion compared to analysts’ expectation of$78.2 billion for the quarter. The results capture the first full quarter of availability for the iPhone 17, which came out in September. And the stakes were high: Apple has been widely perceived as behind in AI, putting more pressure on core products like the iPhone to succeed. Apple (AAPL) also announced that there are now 2.5 billion Apple devices in use globally. CEO Tim Cook told analysts on Thursday that the company saw record iPhone upgradesand double-digit growth on “switchers,” users who switch from Android to the iPhone. Revenue in China, a market where Apple has struggled, also grew to $25.5 billion for the quarter compared to $18.5 billion a year ago. “The demand for iPhone was simply staggering,” Cook said. The results come after a challenging 2025 for Apple. Last year, the company grappled with tariffs and a high-profile delay of its revamped version of Siri, which Cook said on the call will arrive this year. Apple and Google recently announced that the search giant’s AI and cloud technology will power the iPhone maker’s AI models, including the upcoming Siri. Despite the strong results, Apple still has hurdles ahead. Manufacturers arepivoting resources to creating memory for data centers rather than consumer products like smartphones,creating a memory shortagein the tech industry. Cook said that Apple is currently “constrained” and that it’s “difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance.” He added that the memory shortage had a “minimal impact” on the December quarter but might be more noticeable in the current quarter. The iPhone 17 lineup has been broadly successful, butdemand for the iPhone Airhas been muted, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. And while the partnership with Google signals that Apple is making progress in AI, it’ll still face pressure to show how it will use AI in new products. When asked about when Apple plans to make money off AI, Cook said that AI “opens up a range of opportunities” across Apple’s “products and services.” He added that the company is “very happy” with its arrangement with Google. Apple didn’t share more about the partnership, whichCook said should be viewed as a “collaboration.”",2026-01-29T23:07:22.257Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/29/tech/apple-earnings-iphone-17-sales-ai,Lisa Eadicicco,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256863144.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:17
"People aren’t buying into Apple’s big bet on a slimmer iPhone, survey suggests","Apple bet big ona dramatic redesignof its iPhone last year, thebiggest shakeup to its flagship smartphone in nearly a decade. But the slimmer iPhone Air hasn’t seemed to resonate with buyers. New market research data indicates iPhone Air adoption lags far behind the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max: Just 6% of US iPhone shoppers surveyed by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners purchased the iPhone Air in the quarter ending in December, the phone’s first full quarter of availability. By comparison, 22% bought the regular iPhone 17; 25% bought the iPhone 17 Pro; and 27% chose the pricey iPhone 17 Pro Max, according to the report. The numbers were shared with CNN ahead of their release on Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) is set to report earnings on Thursday afternoon and will announce global iPhone revenue for the quarter. But it doesn’t break out numbers for specific iPhone models. There have already been reports ofweak demandfor the iPhone Air. But Apple, the world’s largest smartphone makerby someestimates, might not need a smash hit. TheInternational Data Corporationforecast a record number of shipments this year for Apple driven by its latest iPhone 17 lineup. And some analysts say the iPhone Air was never really intended to be a bestseller. Instead, the phone was meant to add more variety for buyers and set the stage for more advanced  iPhones, such as models that fold in half. The iPhone Air is Apple’s attempt to make smartphones exciting again Still, the iPhone Air’s frosty reception raisesquestions about how Apple can evolve beyond the tried-and-true iPhone lineup: the standard, Pro and Pro Max models. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding iPhone Air sales, launch plans for a future version or changes to production plans. The new data from CIRP indicates a sizable gap in interest between the Air and the rest of Apple’s latest iPhones. The report is based on a survey conducted between January 2 and 21 of 500 US consumers who purchased an Apple product between October and December 2025. It’s not the first indication of sluggish demand for the iPhone Air, which was released in September, at the same time as the iPhone 17 models.The Informationreported in November that Apple is delaying the second-generation model after sales failed to meet expectations. Apple reportedly cut production of the iPhone Air last fall and ramped up orders for the other models, according toNikkei Asian Review. There may be asimple reason why consumers aren’t interested in the iPhone Air, according to Josh Lowitz, one of the CIRP analysts behind the study: People don’t care about thin phones. Most respondents who bought the iPhone Air did so because they were replacing an old phone, not because they wanted a thinner phone, Lowitz said. Carolina Milanesi, president and principal analyst for tech industry analysis firm Creative Strategies, agrees. Consumers aren’t going into stores saying, “Oh my god, I wish this was lighter,” Milanesi said. “We are used to carrying what we carry. So it wasn’t a problem per se.” Phones might get pricier next year. Thank the AI boom Apple has struggled to find a fourth iPhone model that resonates strongly with consumers. It previously offered smaller and larger versions of the standard iPhone, called the iPhone Mini and iPhone Plus respectively. But Apple scrapped both of those from its lineup after reportedly weak demand. The iPhone Air doesn’t outshine the rest of the lineup in any area but thinness. The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the largest screen, longest-lasting battery and a camera with three lenses. The iPhone 17 Pro is cheaper and smaller than the Pro Max and shares many of its other features. The iPhone 17 is the least expensive of the bunch but still has an additional camera and longer battery life compared to the Air, although Apple’s thinner phone has a larger screen and more powerful chip. “The 17 Pro, Pro Max and the base 17 cover a lot of the features,” CIRP analyst Michael Levin said. “And they kind of suck a lot of the oxygen out of the room.” Some analysts like Milanesi saythe iPhone Air is about much more than short-term sales. The newdesign and engineering changes could pave the way for a foldable iPhone, whichBloomberg reportscould arrive this year. Unlike other models, the chips that power the iPhone Air are embedded in the camera module near the top of the device, allowing more space in the main body for the battery. That enables Apple to achieve a slimmer design without compromising much on battery life. Such a change could be important for a future foldable iPhone considering those types of phones tend to be thicker than regular smartphones when closed. Samsung’s biggest new phone in years may launch in the US this year Devices with innovative designs such as the iPhone Air and foldable phones typically appeal to early adopters rather than the average consumer. Even though that audience represents a small slice of the smartphone market, it’s an important market for Apple to capture, said Milanesi. It’s a key part of how Apple portrays itself as being on the cutting edge of design and technology. “I might not buy the Air but still think that Apple is the best company because they brought the Air,” said Milanesi. “So there’s that halo that you get from a brand perspective.”",2026-01-28T14:00:58.834Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/28/tech/iphone-air-new-apple-17,Lisa Eadicicco,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25252694820340.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:24
"Amazon is laying off 16,000 employees as AI battle intensifies","Amazon is laying off 16,000 employees, the company’ssecond round of large-scale jobreductions in three months as it fights to improve its standing in the battle for AI supremacy. In ablog postWednesday, the company said it needed to reduce red tape to increase its decision-making speed. “We’ve been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy,” said Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people. Amazonin late October announced it was cutting 14,000 corporate employees, following a directive from CEO Andy Jassy’s vision of operating like the world’s biggest startup. He wants the company to remain nimble so it can adapt and change quickly asAI upends the technology sector. Amazon is America’s second-largest private employer, behind Walmart. It has over 350,000 corporate employees, according to a 2024surveyfiled to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The culmination of both the recent rounds of cuts represent about 9% of the company’s overall office staff. Galetti said in the blog post that the waves of layoffs won’t become a “new rhythm,” even though Jassy predicted Amazon would continue to reduce its employment rollsbecause of AI. Instead, Amazon is evaluating the “ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate,” Galetti said. She added, however, that Amazon will hire strategically to ramp up in parts of the business that are critical to the company’s future. Amazon is in stiff competition with Microsoft, Google, Meta, OpenAI and a host of other technology companies that are battling to ramp up computing power and large language models that they believe will power the economy of the future. That’s an expensive endeavor, but Jassy has said these layoffs are about efficiency rather than cost savings. Layoffs will begin Wednesday across the company. Most employees will be given 90 days to look for new roles internally, while people who aren’t rehired at Amazon will be given severance pay and additional benefits, the company said. The layoffs werereportedlyannounced to staff Tuesday night in an internal email. That memo was apparently sent inadvertently, because it referred to the blog post that wasn’t published until Wednesday morning. Amazon separately announced Tuesday it wouldclose its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Gogrocery businesses, as it doubles down on its Whole Foods branded stores. Jassy has been outspoken about AI’s impact on Amazon. Last year, he wrote in a blog post to employees that efficiency gains from the technology would allow the company to reduce its workforce. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he bluntly admitted. Jassy said Amazon wasn’t unique in that respect: He envisioned billions of AI agents being put into service across every company and field. “Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast,” Jassy said. Despite the angst that AI is taking white-collar jobs, the fear that it’s broadly happening is overblown, according to areport from Vanguard. In fact, jobs that are highly exposed to AI automation are growing faster than they did prior to the pandemic – even faster than all other occupations, the investment firm recently said. The findings don’t necessarily signal an all-clear for workers worried about AI disrupting their careers. Some companies have recently reported they’re eliminating some positions because AI can automate entry-level workers’ tasks or make current workers more efficient. Yet there’s no evidence the technology is doing widespread damage, at least not yet. This story has been updated with additional developments and context.",2026-01-28T10:59:58.410Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/28/tech/amazon-layoffs-ai,Jordan Valinsky,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2194916913.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:33
"Meta and YouTube head to trial to defend against youth addiction, mental health harm claims","For years, social media giants have argued against claims that their platforms harm young people’s mental health. Starting Tuesday, they will for the first time have to defend against those claims before a jury in a court of law. A 19-year-old, identified as KGM, and her mother, Karen Glenn, sued TikTok, Meta, Snap and Google’s YouTube, alleging that the companies knowingly created addictive features that harmed her mental health and led to self-harm and suicidal thoughts. TikTok agreed to settle the case under undisclosed terms one day beforethe suit was set to go totrial, according to the plaintiff’s attorney Mark Lanier.Snap settled last week under undisclosed terms. Parents, advocates, health experts,tech whistleblowersandteens themselveshave for years worried that that social media platforms can get young people hooked on scrolling, enable bullying, disrupt their sleep and send them downharmful content rabbit holes. Tech executives have repeatedly been hauled before Congress, at one point even apologizing to parents who say their children died or were harmed because of social media. But the companies have nonetheless faced few consequences or regulationsin the United States. KGM’s case seeks unspecified monetary damages. The outcome could influence how more than 1,000 similar personal injury cases against Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube are resolved. Lanier told CNN he hopes the Snap and TikTok settlements in the KGM case could set the stage for the companies to settle the other cases. Top executives from Meta, TikTok and YouTube are expected to take the witness stand during the trial, which takes place in Los Angeles and is set to last several weeks. In recent years, TikTok, Meta, YouTube and Snap have rolled out safety features and policies, as well as parental control tools, that they say protect young users. The four social media companies are involved in other cases this year as well, including some brought by school districts and state attorneys general. Losses could put the tech companies on the hook for billions of dollars in damages and force them to change their platforms. “For parents whose children have been exploited, groomed, or died because of big tech platforms, the next six weeks are the first step toward accountability after years of being ignored by these companies,” said Sarah Gardner, CEO of the non-profit Heat Initiative, which advocates for child safety online. “These are the tobacco trials of our generation, and for the first time, families across the country will hear directly from big tech CEOs about how they intentionally designed their products to addict our kids.” KGM’s lawsuit alleges that the social media giants intentionally designed their platforms to be addictive, despite knowing the risks to young people. KGM, a California teen, started using social media at age 10, despite her mom’s attempts to use third party software to block access to the platforms, according to court documents. “Defendants design their products in a manner that enables children to evade parental consent,” the complaint states. The “addictive design” of Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat and frequent notifications led her to use the platforms compulsively, the suit alleges, which corresponded with a decline in her mental health. Features that recommend other users to connect with on Snapchat and Instagram “facilitated and created connections between minor Plaintiff K.G.M. and complete strangers, including predatory adults and others she did not know in real life,” the complaint states. Instagram and TikTok also allegedly “targeted” KGM with “depressive” and “harmful social comparison and body image” content. Lawsuit alleges social media giants buried their own research on teen mental health harms On Instagram, KGM alleges she was bullied and sextorted — a scam where a bad actor threatens to share explicit photos of a person if they don’t send money or more photos. It took two weeks and “K.G.M.’s friends and family spamming and asking other Instagram users to report the persons targeting” her for Meta to address the problem, according to the complaint. “Defendants’ knowing and deliberate product design, marketing, distribution, programming and operational decision and conduct caused serious emotional and mental harms to K.G.M. and her family,” the complaint states. “Those harms include, but are not limited to, dangerous dependency on their products, anxiety, depression, self-harm, and body dysmorphia.” KGM’s is one of several bellwether cases in a larger multi-district litigation consolidating around 1,500 personal injury cases alleging similar harms because of TikTok, YouTube, Meta and Snap. In 2024, then-US Surgeon General Vivek Murthycalled on Congressto mandate a tobacco-style warning label on social media platforms in light of the “mental health crisis” among young people, somethingstate attorneys generalhave also advocated for. And a Pew Research Centerstudypublished last year indicated that nearly half of US teens believe social media has “mostly negative” effects on people their age. But tech leaders have for years rejected the idea that social media harms young people’s mental health. They point to alack of conclusive researchon the subject and argue that their platforms provide benefits such as entertainment and connection to friends. Tech giants have also repeatedly relied on Section 230, a federal law that shields them from liability over content that their users post, as a defense against safety claims. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl, who is overseeing the KGM and related cases,said last yearthat jurors should consider whether design features implemented by the companies, like endlessly scrolling feeds, have contributed to mental health harms rather than content alone. Snap haspreviously saidthat Snapchat was “designed differently from traditional social media — it opens to the camera, not a feed, and has no public likes or social comparison metrics.” YouTube will let parents stop their teens from endlessly scrolling short videos Snapchat’s youth safety measures include parental control tools,message warningsdesgined to prevent sextortion and mechanisms for removing age-inappropriate content. Asked for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed CNN to a website dedicated to its response to the youth mental health lawsuits, where the company claims the suits “misportray our company and the work we do every day to provide young people with safe, valuable experiences online.” “We have listened to parents, researched the issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens online,” Meta states. “Despite the snippets of conversations or cherry-picked quotes that plaintiffs’ counsel may use to paint an intentionally misleading picture of the company, we’re proud of the progress we’ve made, we stand by our record of putting teen safety first, and we’ll keep making improvements.” Meta’s teen safety features include“teen accounts,”which launched in 2024 to provide default privacy protections and content limits for teen users on Instagram. It also provides parentalsupervisiontools and uses AI to try to identify minor users regardless of the age they provide when they sign up for Meta’s platforms. In a statement to CNN, YouTube spokesperson José Castañeda said the allegations in the youth mental health lawsuits are “simply not true.” “Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work. In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls,” he said in the statement. YouTube’s youth safety measures include restrictions on certain kinds of sensitive content, such as violent or sexually suggestive videos, as well as AI identification of minor users. It also offers parental control tools andlast week rolled outan option for parents to limit or block their kids from scrolling through its short-form video feed, among other new offerings. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Theyouth safety and parental control featuresTikTok has rolled out in recent years include adding default privacy settings and disabling late-night notifications. Last year, it introduced a“guided meditation”feature purportedly aimed at getting teens to cut back on scrolling. Despite those efforts, many parents and advocates say social media platforms have still failed to protect young users. Soon, a jury will have a chance to decide if they agree.",2026-01-26T10:00:48.168Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/social-media-youth-mental-health-trial,Clare Duffy,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2216108329.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:45
TikTok users say they can’t upload anti-ICE videos. The company blames tech issues,"The comedian Megan Stalter, who posts absurd character skits to an audience in the high hundreds of thousands across Instagram and TikTok, tried sharing a different kind of video on Saturday night. Driven by thedeath of Alex Pretti, the nurse shot by a federal immigration agent or agents that day, she had recorded herself urging her fellow Christians to speak out against ICE raids in Minneapolis. “We have to abolish ICE,” Stalter said in thevideo. “I truly, truly believe that is exactly what Jesus would do.” On Instagram, the video was reposted more than 12,000 times. But her plea never made it to TikTok. In a follow-up post on Instagram, shesaidshe had attempted to upload the video to TikTok several times with no success, then had given up and deleted her TikTok account entirely, believing her content was being censored because it was about ICE. (CNN has reached out to Stalter for comment.) Other users reported the same combination of events, drawing a circumstantial connection between their efforts to make videos about ICE and the difficulties they had posting them over the weekend. The controversy caught the attention of Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, whosaidthat among “threats to democracy,” the purported censorship on TikTok was “at the top of the list.” (CNN has reached out to Murphy’s office for comment.) TikTok said in a statement that glitches on the app were due to a power outage at a US data center. As a result, a spokesperson forTikTok US Joint Venturetold CNN, it’s taking longer for videos to be uploaded and recommended to other users. The tech issues were “unrelated to last week’s news,” TikTok said. On Tuesday morning, TikTok US Joint Venturesaidit had made “significant progress” in restoring service to US users but noted that users may still have trouble uploading new videos. Last week, a majority American-owned joint venture took control of TikTok’s assets in the US, in a deal shepherded by the Trump administration under a 2024 law requiring the app to move out from under its previous Chinese ownership or face a ban in the United States. Among its new investors is the tech company Oracle, whose executive chair Larry Ellison is a close affiliate of President Donald Trump. Oracle will store US TikTok users’ data in a “secure US cloud environment,” according toTikTok, and the new joint venture will “have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.” As a private platform, TikTok is free to exert influence on what users can upload or see. Even if accusations of TikTok’s censorship are unprovable, it’s understandable that US users would be increasingly skeptical of the platform in this moment, said Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “There’s not a lot of trust in the leadership of social media platforms in general,” Fiesler told CNN. “And given the connection of the new ownership of TikTok to the Trump administration, which is so wrapped up in what is happening with ICE in Minnesota, it’s not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust.” Fiesler said she was “unsurprised” about censorship concerns on TikTok, given the timing. Almost immediately after oversight of TikTok’s US operations changed, misinformation started to spread about changes to the app’s new terms of service, including those that applied to location sharing and data collection, Fiesler said. “A lot of TikTok users are concerned about what this new ownership means, both with respect to who has access to their data, and how content recommendation might change or could change,” Fiesler said. “I think those are valid concerns.” A few days ago, Fieslerpostedsome videos aiming to debunk those rumors about the changes to the terms of service, and those were uploaded without issue. She has attempted to upload two videos since Sunday afternoon, one of which she says is still “under review” by TikTok and can’t be viewed publicly. While both generally alluded to ongoing ICE action in Minneapolis, she used it as a framing device to discuss media literacy. One of the videos did successfullyuploadon Monday, though its captions and view counter weren’t working for several hours, she said. “Even if this isn’t purposeful censorship, does it matter? In terms of perception and trust, maybe,” Fiesler said. Jen Hamilton, a nurse and author with more than 4.5 millionTikTok followers, says she became suspicious of TikTok on January 22, the day of the announced change in control in the US, when a video she made about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos being taken by federal agents wouldn’t upload. “It was very ironic for that very first day of this takeover, for me to post something about ICE and then it not be viewable to the public,” Hamilton told CNN, adding that the video still can’t be seen by her followers. After she posted a still about Pretti, her next four videos couldn’t be uploaded, she said. “Something has shifted in the way that content is getting put on the platform, or allowed to be on the platform,” she said, while noting that she didn’t have proof of being personally censored. “And I just find it very ironic that it’s the same day that it takes over that people are not being able to post their stuff.” It would be incredibly difficult to prove TikTok is censoring content about ICE because the platform’s content recommendation process is so opaque, said Jeffrey Blevins, a professor at the University of Cincinnati who studies media law and ethics, among other subjects. Plus, if TikTokwereintentionally censoring content about ICE, it would be within its legal right. “They’re a private platform. They have a First Amendment right to do that,” he said. “A lot of times it’s easy for us to think of social media as a public square, but it’s not public in a way that matters under the law.” Some users, like Stalter, are deleting their accounts and leaving the app altogether (though some have also had trouble deleting their accounts, Fiesler noted). The daily average of TikTok uninstalls are up nearly 150% in the last five days compared to the last three months, market firm SensorTowertoldCNBC on Monday. “If people leave TikTok now, I suspect it’s a combination of things, not just because some videos weren’t posted on one day. It’s also concerns about what this means for the future.” Hamilton said while she’s exploring options like Substack and Patreon, where followers can pay to hear her unvarnished thoughts, she won’t fully abandon TikTok. “This whole thing is intended to dissuade people, especially who are sharing a narrative that is not similar to what the government is wanting people to hear,” she said she suspects. “I think the purpose of having those people feel like their content is not safe on this platform is to get them to stop speaking out, or use the platform differently, or play by the rules.” She’s already figured out ways to continue to talk about ICE, she said. In a video thatdidmake it through TikTok’s uploading process, she calls herself a “fashion influencer” and speaks in code about her trouble uploading an earlier video about Liam. “Fashion influencing is in my blood,” she said in the video, with a photo of Liam behind her. “And even a company with bad customer service won’t keep me from doing my fashion review.”",2026-01-27T02:55:18.241Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/tiktok-ice-censorship-glitch-cec,Scottie Andrew,tech,ctt,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2258022749-20260127015621591.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:33:52
Europe opens major probe into Elon Musk’s X after outcry over sexualized images,"The European Union has launched a wide-reaching investigation into Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot on X following global outrage over its ability to generate sexually explicit images, including of children. The scandal erupted at the end of last year when the AI chatbot churned out a barrage of digitally undressed images of women and children in response to requests from users. The global outcry that followed was met by an initial announcement by X that the tool would be limited to paying subscribers, but the company eventuallyprevented all usersfrom using Grok to create images of real people in revealing clothing. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in astatementMonday that the investigation would examine whether X “properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok’s functionalities into X in the EU.” Henna Virkkunen, a senior commission official focusing on technology, as well security and democracy, said in the statement:“Sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations… or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.” When contacted for comment, X referred CNN to a January 14statementon its social media platform that said among other things: “We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking Child Sexual Exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.” After days of outrage, X restricts Grok’s ability to create explicit images In a briefing for journalists, another European Commission official acknowledged the measures taken by X so far but said the company had not properly assessed the risksbefore launchingthe chatbot. The probe was openedunder the EU’s Digital Services Act, which requires Big Tech companies to do more to tackle illegal and harmful online content. There is no timeline for completing the probenor any indication of what action the European Commision might take based onits findings. However, the official, who asked to remain anonymous, told journalists the body had “quite a few tools at our disposal” and that a fine was possible. “What we are after is changing the platform’s behavior,” they said. The EU hitthe social media platform with a fine of around $140 million in December, saying the “deceptive design” of its blue verification checkmark and other featuresviolated the Digital Services Act. At the time, Musk called the fine “crazy.” When asked whether the fine had been paid, the unnamed EU official said it had not but that the company still had time to settle it. Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta alsoannounced an investigationinto the “proliferation of non-consensual sexually explicit material produced using Grok.” Grok is still banned in Indonesia and Malaysia as a result of the image generation controversy. UK regulator Ofcom has also launched aformal investigationinto X.

The deal to secure TikTok’s future in the US has finally closed,"The joint venture acquiring TikTok’s US assets has been formally established and has announced its leadership team,according to the company,one day before the deadline set by President Donald Trump for the app’s US assets to be spun off by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The transaction’s close concludes a yearslong effort to secure TikTok’s long-term future in the United States and address concerns that it posed a national security risk. “The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,” the group said in a statement Thursday. The joint venture will be led by CEO Adam Presser, who previously led TikTok’s efforts to secure Americans’ user data in the United States, and Chief Security Officer Will Farrell, who led privacy and security for the effort. It will be overseen by a board that includes TikTok US CEO Shou Chew; Kenneth Glueck, Executive Vice President in the Office of the Chief Executive Officer at Oracle; and representatives of investment firm Susquehanna International Group and private equity firm Silver Lake, Emirati investment firm MGX, among others. Trump thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for “working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal.” “He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision,” Trump said in hisTruth Social post. The Chinese government has not directly addressed the final deal structure. CNN has reached out to China’s Ministry of Commerce for comment. Trump also said he was “so happy to have helped in saving TikTok,” and expressed appreciation to those in his administration who brought the deal to a “very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.” The US TikTok saga began when Trump, during his first term, vowed to ban the app. It ramped up in 2024 when then-President Joe Biden signed a law requiring that the US version of the app be spun off from its parent company, ByteDance, or be banned in the United States. During his second term, Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law as he sought a deal to transfer control of the app’s US operations to American ownership. When he approved the deal last fall, Trump gave the parties a January 23 deadline to finalize the transaction. TikToksignedthe deal last month. The deal will likely be good news to TikTok’s more than 200 million American users, many of whom rely on the app for entertainment, news and, in some cases, even their livelihoods. The agreement transferred control of TikTok’s US user data and most of its US operations to a new joint venture, 50% of which will be owned by a consortium of investors comprised of tech company Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Emirati-backed investment firm MGX. Just over 30% of the joint venture will be held by “affiliates of certain existing investors in ByteDance,” and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to amemoChew sent to employees last month. The new entity plans to retrain TikTok’s algorithm on US user data, and Oracle will oversee storage of Americans’ data. The US joint venture will also be responsible for content moderation for US users. However, the ByteDance-controlled global TikTok entity will continue to manage e-commerce, advertising and marketing on the new US platform, according to Chew’s memo. That means American users’ experience on the app is unlikely to change in a visible way, although the algorithm that determines what videos are served to their feeds could shift as the new ownership group takes control. Trump last yeardesignated the spinoff dealas a “qualified divestiture” under the sale-or-ban law. But questions remain about whether the arrangement fully addresses the core national security concerns that motivated US lawmakers to pass the law on a bipartisan basis in the first place. US officials had worried that ByteDance could be forced to manipulate the algorithm on behalf of the Chinese government to influence or generate dissent among Americans. The TikTok ban-or-sale law prohibited “any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm” between ByteDance and a new potential American ownership group. “Interoperability enables the Joint Venture to provide U.S. users with a global TikTok experience, ensuring U.S. creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale,” the joint venture group said in its statement. Democratic Senator Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, said Friday that the final deal “raises many more questions than answers.” “Despite my repeated requests for information, the White House has provided virtually no details about this agreement, including whether TikTok’s algorithm is truly free of Chinese influence,” Markey said in a statement. “This lack of transparency reeks. Congress has a responsibility to investigate this deal, demand transparency, and ensure that any arrangement truly protects national security while keeping TikTok online.” Under the deal finalized Thursday, the new joint venture will continue to license the TikTok algorithm from ByteDance before retraining and reviewing it. Whether Beijing would approve the deal had also remained uncertain up until the deal’s close. TikTok had become a leverage point in broader US-China trade negotiations; an earlier version of the deal wasderailedlast year after Trump announced a new round of tariffs. Last month, He Yongqian, a spokesperson for the ministry,reiteratedthat Beijing and Washington had reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues about TikTok and trade. “The Chinese government hopes that enterprises will arrive at solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and reflect a balance of interests,” He said at a presser. “China hopes that the US side will work in the same direction as China, earnestly fulfill its relevant commitments, provide a fair, open, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment for the continued stable operation of Chinese enterprises in the US.” CNN’s John Liu in Hong Kong and Joyce Jiang in Beijing contributed reporting.",2026-01-23T00:32:02.961Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/22/tech/tiktok-us-deal-closes,Clare Duffy,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/16-tiktokapp-bej-20260122212850523.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:34:08
Like digging ‘your own professional grave’: The translators grappling with losing work to AI,"As a rare Irish-language translator, Timothy McKeon enjoyed steady work for European Union institutions for years. But the rise of artificial intelligence tools that can translate text and, increasingly, speech nearly instantly has upended his livelihood and that of many others in his field. He says he lost about 70% of his income when the EU translation work dried up. Now, available work consists of polishing machine-generated translations, jobs he refuses “on principle” because they help train the software taking work away from human translators. When the edited text is fed back into the translation software, “it learns from your work.” “The more it learns, the more obsolete you become,” he said. “You’re essentially expected to dig your own professional grave.” While workers worldwide ponder how AI might affect their livelihoods – a topic on theagendaatthe World Economic Forum in Davos this week – that question is no longer hypothetical in the translation industry. Apps like Google Translate already reduced the need for human translators, and increased adoption of generative AI has only accelerated that trend. A 2024surveyof writing professionals by the United Kingdom’s Society of Authors showed that more than a third of translators had lost work due to generative AI, which can create sophisticated text, as well as images and audio, from users’ prompts.And43% of translators said their income had dropped because of the technology. In the United States, data from 2010-23 analyzed byCarl Frey and Pedro Llanos-Paredes at Oxford Universityshowedthat regions where Google Translate was in greater use saw slower growth in the number of translator jobs. Originally powered by statistical translation, Google Translate shifted to a technique called neural translation in 2016, resulting in more natural-sounding text and bringing it closer to today’s AI tools. “Our best baseline estimate is that roughly 28,000 more jobs for translators would’ve been added in the absence of machine translation,” Frey told CNN. “It’s not a story of mass displacement but I think that’s very likely to follow.” The story is similar globally, suggests McKeon: He is part of theGuerrilla Media Collective, an international group of translators and communications professionals, and says everyone in the collective supplements their income with other work due to the impact of AI. Christina Green is president of Green Linguistics, a provider of language services, and a court interpreter in Wisconsin. She worries her court role could soon vanish because of abillthat would allow courts to use AI or other machine translation in civil or criminal proceedings, and in certain other cases. Green and other language professionals have been fighting the proposal since it was introduced in May. “The entire US is looking at Wisconsin” as a precedent, Green said, noting that the bill’s opponents had so far succeeded in stalling it. While Green still has her court job, her companyrecently lost a majorFortune 10corporate client, whichshe said opted to use a company offering AI translationinstead. The client accounted for such an outsized share of her company’s business that she had to make layoffs. “People and companies think they’re saving money with AI, but they have absolutely no clue what it is, how privacy is affected and what the ramifications are,” Green said. Fardous Bahbouh, based in London, is an Arabic-language translator and interpreter for international media organizations, including CNN. She has seena considerable reduction in written work in recent years, which she attributes to technological developments and the financial pressures facing media outlets. Bahbouh is also studying for a PhD focusing on the translation industry. Her research shows that technology, including AI, is “hugely impacting” translators and interpreters. “I worry a great deal that governments are not doing enough to help them transition into other work, which could lead to greater inequality, in-work poverty and child poverty,”she told CNN. Many translators are indeed looking to retrain “because translation isn’t generating the income it previously did,” according to Ian Giles, a translator and chair of the Translators Association at theUK’s Society of Authors. The picture is similar in the United States: Many translators are leaving the profession, Andy Benzo, president of the American Translators Association, told CNN. And Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said in Davos Thursday that the number of translators and interpreters at the fund had gone down to 50 from 200 due to greater use of technology. Governments should also do more for those remaining in the translation industry, by introducing stronger labor protections, Bahbouh argued. Despite advances in machine translation and interpretation, technology can’t replace human language workers entirelyjust yet. While using AI tools for everyday tasks like finding directions is “low-risk,” human translators will likely need to be involved for the foreseeable future in diplomatic, legal, financial and medical contexts where the risks are “humongous,” according to Benzo. “I’m a translator and a lawyer and in both professions the nuance of each word is very specific and the (large language models powering AI tools) aren’t there yet, by far,” she said. Meta apologizes after auto-translation mistakenly announces Indian state chief minister’s death Another field relatively untouched by machine translation tools is literary translation. Giles, whotranslates commercial fiction from Scandinavian languages into English, used to supplement his income with translation work from companies, but that has now disappeared. Meanwhile, literary commissions have continued to come in, he said. There’s also one key element of communication that AI can’t replace, according to Oxford University’s Frey: Human connection. “The fact that machine translation is pervasive doesn’t mean you can build a relationship with somebody in France without speaking a word of French,” he said.",2026-01-23T11:00:47.866Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/23/tech/translation-language-jobs-ai-automation-intl,Lianne Kolirin,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2023840777.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:34:16
Elizabeth Holmes asks Trump to let her out of prison early,"Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced Theranos CEO, has asked President Donald Trump for an early release from prison after being convicted of defrauding investors, according to a request filed last year with the Department of Justice. Holmes was convicted in 2022 and reported to a federal prison in Texas in 2023 to serve outher 11-year sentence, which is currently set to end in December 2031. Holmes’ request to commute her sentence, if granted, could see her released nearly six years early. Last year, a US appeals courtupheld the convictionsof Holmes and Theranos President Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. It alsoupheldthe $452 million in restitution that Holmes and Balwani were ordered to pay to victims. Holmes started Theranos,once valued at $9 billion, as a college student and quickly became one of the most well known women in Silicon Valley thanks to her promise to upend the healthcare industry. Theranos claimed its technology could accurately and efficiently test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. It attracted $945 million in financing, a board of well-known political figures and prominent retail partners. But aWall Street Journal investigationcalled into question the company’s testing methods and the capabilities of its technology. In 2018, Holmes and Balwani were each charged with a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both pleaded not guilty. Holmes, 41, is currently serving out her sentence at Federal Prison Camp Bryan, a minimum security federal prison camp approximately 100 miles from Houston. The White House does not comment on clemency requests, and the final decision on any pardons or commutations rests with the president, a White House official told CNN. Attorneys for Holmes could not be immediately reached for comment. In recent months, Holmes has gained renewed attention online after posts again began appearing on her X account, including a recent post lauding Trump’shealth care affordability efforts. The Holmes account, which also features posts about Holmes’ husband, children and activities in prison, notes that posts are “mostly my words, posted by others.” It’s not clear who is managing the account. “We are continuing to fight for my innocence and we know the truth can not be repressed for ever (sic),” Holmes’ accountpostedWednesday evening.

Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary welcomes public feud with Elon Musk,"Michael O’Leary, CEO of Europe’s biggest airline,Ryanair, says his ongoing feud with tech billionaireElon Muskhas boosted the budget carrier’s ticket sales. “It is very good for our bookings,” O’Leary said at a news conference in Dublin on Wednesday, highlighting the fact that the company has been running a “Big Idiot Seat Sale” in recent days. “We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair,” he said, adding that the airline would be offering Musk a free ticket. The squabble began after the Ryanair(RYAAY)bosssaid on January 14 that he wouldn’t install Starlink satellite Wi-Fi technology, which is made by Musk’s firm SpaceX, on the airline’s planes, due to concerns over drag and an associated increase in fuel costs. In aposton X the same day, Musk said O’Leary was “misinformed.” “I doubt they can even measure the difference in fuel use accurately,” he added. Musk also called O’Leary “an utter idiot” and a “retarded twat.” On Friday, O’Leary, who is famously outspoken and known for his skill in harnessing publicity, fired back during aninterviewwith Irish radio station Newstalk. “I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk. He’s an idiot — very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot,” he said. “What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.” Ryanair is suing ‘disruptive passenger’ for $15,000 in damages SpaceX, which Musk founded, is a rocket manufacturer and space transport services company. On Wednesday, O’Leary said he took “no insult” from Musk’s comments. “As anybody with teenage children would know, you’re frequently called an idiot and a twat at home,” he said. “I don’t need to go outside to be insulted.” O’Leary also provided further details behind the decision not to offer Starlink internet connectivity on Ryanair planes, as an increasing number of other airlines have started to do. “It is a very good system,” said O’Leary. “The problem is if you put it on board aircraft, there is a cost.” O’Leary estimates that it would cost Ryanair around $200-250 million a year in installation fees and increased running costs due to fuel drag caused by the two antennae that would have to be installed on the fuselage of each of the company’s 643 planes. Ryanair would not be able to recover these costs by charging passengers to use the service, according to O’Leary. Elon Musk’s Starlink to launch on United Airlines flights by spring Although Starlink claims that around 90% of passengers are willing to pay for internet access, the airline has found that less than 10% would do so, he said. O’Leary also expressed his surprise that the decision had resulted in a feud, which has also seen Musk raise the possibility of buying Ryanair. “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?” hewroteon Friday. “How much would it cost to buy you?” he wrote in anotherreplyto the airline that day. On Wednesday, O’Leary said that while non-European Union citizens cannot own a majority stake in European airlines, he would welcome Musk’s investment. “We would think it’s a very good investment, certainly a significantly better investment than the financial returns he is earning on X,” he said. “And we want to thank him sincerely for the additional publicity.”",2026-01-21T14:19:55.741Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/21/tech/ryanair-oleary-musk-spat-scli-intl,Jack Guy,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2026-01-21t100833z-2088126067-rc2l5jalel6o-rtrmadp-3-ryanair-oleary-musk.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:34:32
What is the heliosphere? A new mission could unravel the mysteries of this complex cosmic environment,"Surrounding our solar system is a natural and enigmatic cosmic shield called the heliosphere — and a new mission has launched to help astronomers better understand it. Created by the solar wind, a constant flow of charged particles that stream away from the sun, theheliosphereacts as an enormous bubble that protects the planets in our solar system from cosmic radiation permeating the Milky Way, our home galaxy. In addition to Earth’s protective magnetic field, the heliosphere plays a major role in why life is possible on our planet — and how it perhaps once existed on others such asMars. Over half a dozen missions   have contributed to how astronomers understand the heliosphere, and two enduring spacecraft, the Voyager probes, havecollected key dataafter exiting the heliosphere to explore interstellar space. But the new IMAP, orInterstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, mission is designed to investigate how the sun forms its solar wind, and how that solar wind interacts with interstellar space at the boundary of the heliosphere, which begins at a range three times the distance between Earth and Pluto, according to NASA. The spacecraft’s 10 instruments will also fill gaps in the existing map of the heliosphere, pieced together from data collected by previous missions, and help further explain how the heliosphere largely shields our solar system from damaging cosmic rays, the most highly energetic particles in the universe. Along with two other space weather missions that lifted off aboard the same rocket on Wednesday, IMAP will help scientists better predict when solar storms unleashed by the sun could affect our planet. When aimed at Earth, harsh radiation from the storms, also known as space weather, can pose risks to astronauts on the International Space Station as well as interfere with communications, the electric power grid, navigation, and radio and satellite operations. “This next set of missions is the ultimate cosmic carpool,” said Dr. Joe Westlake, director of NASA’s Heliophysics Division, during a news conference on Sunday. “They will provide unprecedented insight into space weather. Every human on Earth, as well as nearly every system involved in space exploration and human needs, is affected by space weather.” The heliosphere was first theorized by multiple scientists investigating the concept of cosmic rays and the solar wind in the late 1950s, according toNASA. They believed the sun provided a web of magnetic fields and solar wind thatcreated a boundarysurrounding Earth and the rest of the solar system. Mariner 2, the first successful mission to another planet that performed a flyby of Venus in 1962, also was the first to measure the solar wind, proving its existence. Direct measurements taken by thePioneer 10 and 11 missionsin the 1970s, as well as the Voyager probes, provided further proof of the heliosphere. Scientists are eager to know what the boundaries of the heliosphere look like, something that the Voyager probes have offered tantalizing glimpses of in the past. They are the only two spacecraft to cross the heliosphere. Voyager 1 reached the heliosphere boundary in 2012, while the slower Voyager 2 crossed the boundary in 2018, providing snapshots in two specific locations. The information collected by these probes is helping scientists learn about the heliosphere’s cometlike shape. The IBEX, or Interstellar Boundary Explorer, satellite has been mapping the heliosphere since launching in 2008. But IMAP can explore and map the boundaries of the heliosphere like never before because it has instruments with faster imaging that are capable of 30 times higher resolution. Once it reaches an orbit about 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth in about three months, IMAP will also capture observations of the solar wind in real time and measure particles that travel from the sun, study the heliosphere’s boundary between 6 billion and 9 billion miles (9.7 billion to 14.5 billion kilometers) away, and even collect data from interstellar space. Predominately, IMAP will measure energetic neutral atoms, called ENAs, or uncharged particles that form when an energetic charged ion collides with a slow-moving neutral atom. The process that forms these particles, found wherever there is plasma, or charged gas, in space, also occurs throughout the heliosphere and along its boundary. IMAP will rely on tracking these particles to create a more complete map of the heliosphere, according to NASA. The particles travel in a straight line, unaffected by magnetic fields because they are not charged, so IMAP can collect ENAs near Earth and trace them to their origins, like the otherwise invisible boundaries of the heliosphere, according to NASA. “IMAP is going to make incredibly detailed pictures that will evolve over time of that interaction region,” said Dr. David McComas, IMAP’s principal investigator and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. “It will be able to understand what the shielding is, how the shielding works and what it looks like.” McComas added that our solar system is not alone in having something like a heliosphere, and brightastrosphereshave been spotted around other stars. IMAP launched alongside NASA’s Carruthers Geocorona Observatory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s SWFO-L1, or Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. ET. NASA streamed the launch live onYouTube. TheCarruthers Geocorona Observatoryis a small satellite that will be dedicated to observing the exosphere, or Earth’s outermost atmospheric layer. The Carruthers mission will capture images of the region’s faint ultraviolet glow, called the geocorona, to help answer questions about the exosphere’s shape, size and density. The mission is named for Dr. George Carruthers, who developed an ultraviolet camera as the first moon-based observatory that was placed during the Apollo 16 mission. The camera, still in place in the Descartes highland region on the moon, photographed Earth in ultraviolet light and captured the first image of the exosphere in 1972. The Carruthers mission will measure changes and the effects of space weather once it reaches Earth, given that the exosphere marks a transitional boundary between Earth and space. Meanwhile, theSWFO-L1 missionis intended to act as a solar storm detector, providing early warnings to protect astronauts in low-Earth orbit and satellites that provide critical communications on Earth. It’s a tool that will be even more necessary as astronauts venture farther into deep space. “I think we’re getting better…but a really solid forecast, I think, is still something that we’re striving for,” said Mark Clampin, acting deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, at a news conference for the agency’s upcoming Artemis II mission around the moon. “And obviously the missions that we’re putting up now will give us much better insight into not just the one piece of the problem, but the whole problem, from what’s happening on the sun to how that then propagates out from the sun, and whether it becomes a real problem or not.” Two billionaires have very different — and equally wild — visions of a future in space. Is either possible? The satellite’s compact coronagraph telescope will monitor the sun for activity and measure the solar wind, providing a constant stream of data to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Images of solar storms taken by the satellite can be sent to the center within 30 minutes, while other current missions, like NASA and the European Space Agency’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, launched in 1995, can take up to eight hours. “SWFO-L1’s essential data is our lifeline for keeping the lights on, planes flying and satellites safe, ensuring that America is ready for what the sun sends our way ,” said Clinton Wallace, director of NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center.

Black hole collision confirms decades-old predictions by Einstein and Hawking,"Astronomers have detected a collision between two black holes in unprecedented detail, offering the clearest view yet into the nature of these cosmic oddities and confirming long-held predictions made by legendary physicists Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. The event, dubbed GW250114, became known in January when researchers spotted it with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) — a set of two identical instruments located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. The instruments detected gravitational waves, faint ripples in space-time produced by the two black holes slamming into each other. Searching for gravitational waves, phenomena predicted in 1915 as part of Einstein’s theory of relativity, is the only way to identify black hole collisions from Earth. Einstein believed that the waves would be too weak to ever be picked up by human technology, butin September 2015, LIGOrecorded themfor the very first time, later netting a Nobel Prize for three scientists who made key contributions to the development of this “black hole telescope.” The newly detected black holes were each around 30 to 35 times the mass of the sun, and they were spinning very slowly, said Maximiliano Isi, an assistant professor of astronomy at Columbia University and an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City. Isi led a newstudyfor the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration on the GW250114 data, which published Wednesday in the journal Physical Review Letters. Martian rock contains ‘clearest sign’ yet of ancient life on Mars, NASA says “The black holes were about 1 billion light years away, and they were orbiting around each other in almost a perfect circle,” Isi said. “The resulting black hole was around 63 times the mass of the sun, and it was spinning at 100 revolutions per second.” These characteristics make the merger an almost exact replica of that first, groundbreaking detection from 10 years ago, according to Isi. “But now, because the instruments have improved so much since then, we can see these two black holes with much greater clarity, as they approached each other and merged into a single one,” he added. Isi said the observation gives scientists a totally new view into “the dynamics of space and time.” LIGO, which also has two smaller sister instruments — Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan — is managed by a global scientificcommunityof about 1,600 researchers. It works by detecting tiny stretches in space caused by the gravitational waves that amount to “a change in distance that is 1,000 times smaller than the radius of the nucleus of an atom,” as Isi puts it. Scientists have used it to observe over 300 black hole mergers so far. Earlier this year, the instrument detected themost massive black hole collisionto date between two black holes approximately 100 and 140 times the mass of the sun. Since it debuted, some of LIGO’s key components — including its lasers and mirrors — have been upgraded to increase accuracy and reduce background noise. This improved performance made its new observation over three times more precise than the inaugural one a decade ago. That unprecedented clarity allowed astronomers to use GW250114 to confirm predictions about black holes made decades ago by prominent physicists. The first prediction, devised by New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr in 1963, builds upon Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and states that black holes should be paradoxically simple objects, described by a single equation. “Yes, black holes are very mysterious, complex and have important implications to the evolution of the universe,” Isi said, “but mathematically we think they should be fully described by just two numbers. Everything there is to know about them should come from how big the black hole is — or what its mass is — and how fast it’s rotating.” Brightest fast radio burst ever detected could help solve an enduring cosmic mystery To test this theory, the researchers used a unique feature of black hole collisions: a “ringing” or vibration — like a bell that’s been struck — that the final black hole produces. “If you have a bell and you strike it with a hammer, it will ring,” Isi noted. “The pitch and duration of the sound, the characteristics of the sound, tell you something about what the bell is made of. With black holes something similar happens — they ring in gravitational waves.” This ringing includes information about the structure of the black hole and the space around it, Isi added. Although the phenomenon was faintly observed before, GW250114 returned a signal with “two modes … a fundamental mode and an overtone” with much more clarity. “We identified two components of this ringing, and that allowed us to test that this black hole really is consistent with being described by just two numbers, mass and rotation,” he said. “And this is fundamental to our understanding of how space and time works — that these black holes should be featureless, in some way. It’s the first time we are able to see this so compellingly.” The second prediction confirmed by GW250114 is one made in 1971 by British physicist Stephen Hawking, which states that when two black holes merge, the resulting surface area must be equal to or greater than that of the original black holes. “It’s a profound, but very simple theorem that says the total surface area of a black hole can never decrease — it can only get bigger or stay the same,” Isi said. Although previous LIGO observations offered tentativeconfirmationsof the theorem, the clarity of this new signal gives researchers unparalleled confidence, Isi said. “Because we’re able to identify the portion of the signal that comes from the black holes early on, as they are separated from each other, we can infer their areas from that,” he explained. “Then we can look at the very final portion of the signal that comes from the final black hole, and measure its own area.” Just like Kerr’s equation, Hawking’s theorem also uses Einstein’s work as its foundation: “Einstein’s theories are like the operating system for all of this,” Isi explained. Kip Thorne, one of the three recipients of the Nobel Prize for LIGO contributions, said Hawking called him as soon as he learned of the 2015 gravitational wave detection to ask if LIGO would be able to test his theorem. “If Hawking were alive, he would have reveled in seeing the area of the merged black holes increase,” Thorne said of the esteemed physicist, who died in 2018, in a statement about the new findings. It’s remarkable how this seminal, theoretical work is being confirmed decades later with advanced instruments, Isi said. And confirming Hawking’s equation, he added, could have implications for a very sought-after goal in physics — combining the seemingly incompatible theory of general relativity, which describes gravity, with quantum mechanics, which relates to the subatomic world. “LIGO has created an entire new branch of astronomy. It has revolutionized what we think about compact objects, black holes in particular,” he said. “Before LIGO turned on, people weren’t even sure that black holes could merge and crash and form in this way.” Gravitational waves are very weak, and the titanic task of detecting them is often described as looking for a needle in a haystack, according to Emanuele Berti, a professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the study. He described the LIGO detectors as “hearing aids” that help with this process. “A large group of scientists spent the last ten years improving those hearing aids, and now we can ‘hear’ the signals with much higher clarity,” he said in an email. “We can now test fundamental principles of gravity that we could not test ten years ago.” Among these principles, he added, is the idea that black holes are the simplest macroscopic objects in the universe. The level of detail in the “ringing” produced by the GW250114 collision means scientists can say with confidence that the final object is consistent with the black holes predicted by Einstein’s general relativity, which Berti says is “terribly exciting.” Leor Barack, a professor of mathematical physics at the University of Southampton in England who was also not part of the study, noted that among the more than 300 black-hole merger events recorded by LIGO, the latest one stands out as “particularly spectacular,” and calls the new study a long-awaited analysis. Scientists were able to extract two of the “pure tones” of the remnant black hole as it settled into its final form, Barack added. “This included, for the first time, a clear extraction of the first ‘overtone,’ a fainter harmonious sound of the ringing hole, in addition to the primary tone,” he said. “This kind of test is the most precise to date, by a long margin.” New type of supernova ‘looks like nothing anyone has ever seen before,’ astronomer says The study represents a significant milestone in gravitational wave astronomy, said Macarena Lagos, an assistant professor at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile. Lagos also was not involved with the work. She agreed that the detection of a second tone in the “ringing” black hole is particularly significant, adding that GW250114 demonstrates the success of LIGO’s ongoing improvements and shows that gravitational wave detections can test fundamental physics in ways never before possible. “While current tests of gravity still have broad uncertainties, this work lays the groundwork for future detections” of even better quality expected in the coming years, Lagos said in an email. “These future observations promise to provide more precise tests of our understanding of spacetime and gravity.” Sign up forCNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

"Rock discovery contains ‘clearest sign’ yet of ancient life on Mars, NASA says","Scientists believe intriguing leopard spots on a rock sampled by the Perseverance rover on Mars last year may have potentially been made by ancient life, NASA announced Wednesday. The team has also published a peer-reviewed paper in the journalNatureabout the new analysis, though they say further study is needed. “After a year of review, theyhave come back and they said, listen, we can’t find another explanation,” said Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. “So this very well could be the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars, which is incredibly exciting.” The sample, called Sapphire Canyon, was collected by the Perseverance rover from rocky outcrops on the edges of the Neretva Vallis river valley, a region sculpted by water that once flowed into Jezero Crater more than 3 billion years ago. The rover landed within the crater to explore the ancient lake site in February 2021, seeking rocks created or modified by water on Mars in the past. Perseverance drilled the Sapphire Canyon sample from an arrowhead-shaped rock called Cheyava Falls in July 2024. Although the sample is safely ensconced in a tube millions of miles away on Mars, scientists have remained intrigued by the rock because of its potential to reveal whether microscopic life ever existed on the red planet. “The discovery of a potential biosignature, or a feature or signature that could be consistent with biological processes, but that requires further work and study to confirm a biological origin is something that we’re sharing with you all today that grows from years of hard work, dedication and collaboration between over 1,000 scientists and engineers here at the (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory and our partner institutions around the country and internationally,” said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance project scientist at JPL, during a news conference Wednesday. Shortly after the rock was found, members of the Perseverance science team said it was exactly the type of rock they were hoping to find. NASA initially shared the Cheyava Falls rock discovery at the end of July 2024. The new announcement Wednesday is the result of a long, peer-reviewed research process and the collection of more data, said lead study author Joel Hurowitz, a planetary scientist at Stony Brook University in New York. Peer review and publication are crucial steps in the scientific process that allow NASAto make the mission data and the science team’s interpretation of that data available to the broader science community for further study, said Lindsay Hays, senior scientist for Mars Exploration at NASA’s Planetary Science Division. “Hopefully, eventually this will be followed by the delivery of these samples back to Earth where they could be studied in terrestrial labs,” Hays added. Perseverance rover surveyed the river valley after finding the sample to better understand the environment where the rocks were deposited and determine how the leopard spots may have formed, Hurowitz said. Understanding exactly how those spots came to be — whether through geochemical processes that don’t require life or due to the presence of microbial life — is a crucial step in determining whether the rock contains evidence of a potential biosignature. “Today, we are really showing you how we are kind of one step closer to answering humanity’s, one of their most profound questions, and that is, are we truly alone in the universe?” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. More than 3.5 billion years ago, the Neretva Vallis would have been filled with rushing rivers carrying mud, sand and gravel into the lake, Stack Morgan said. “Inside the crater, this kind of energetic setting was probably punctuated by periods of calm when water would have backed up, creating a relatively low energy lake environment,” she added. When the water eventually dried up, it left behind the rocky outcrop where Cheyava Valls was found, called Bright Angel, preserving a record of a “potential habitable environment” on Mars, Stack Morgan said. “These really ancient rocks provide us the window into a period of time that’s not particularly well represented on our own planet Earth, but it’s a time when life was emergent on Earth, and could have been on Mars as well,” she added. Cheyava Falls, named for one of the Grand Canyon’s waterfalls, showcased small black spots nicknamed “poppy seeds” by Perseverance’s science team, as well as larger markings dubbed leopard spots. “These textural features told us that something really interesting had happened in these rocks, some chemical reactions occurred at the time they were being deposited,” Hurowitz said. The rover’s SHERLOC instrument, or Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals, also detected organic compounds in the rock. The SHERLOC results were a “smoking gun indicator for the presence of organic matter in this mud,” Hurowitz said. Organic compounds were also found in a couple of other locations in the Bright Angel formation. “This tells us that we had a rusty red mud that was deposited in the presence of organic matter,” Hurowitz said. On Earth, these carbon-based molecules are the building blocks of life. The mottling on the rock could indicate that ancient chemical reactions occurring within it once supported microbial organisms. White veins of calcium sulfate present clear evidence that water — crucial for life — once ran through the rock. And the irregular-shaped leopard spots, tested by the rover’s PIXL instrument, short for Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, detected iron and phosphate within the features. The team also spotted the potential presence of hematite between the white bands of calcium sulfate in the rock. Hematite is one of the minerals responsible for Mars’ signature red hue. The leopard spotting may have occurred when chemical reactions with hematite turned the rock from red to white, which can release iron and phosphate and potentially cause the black rings to form. Such reactions can also provide an energy source for microbes. The features are likely due to the presence of ferrous iron phosphate and iron sulfide, or the minerals vivianite and greigite,according to the researchers.Typically, these minerals form in environments with a low temperature and the presence of water. “On Earth, things like these sometimes form in sediments where microbes are eating organic matter and ‘breathing’ rust and sulfate,” said study coauthor Dr. Michael Tice, a geobiologist and astrobiologist in the department of geology and geophysics at Texas A&M University, in a statement. “Their presence on Mars raises the question: could similar processes have occurred there?” In the study, the authors explore two potential scenarios for how the rock features formed: due to the presence of life or without it. While it’s possible that some of the features could be produced strictly geochemically due to reactions between organic matter and iron, that process usually only works at relatively high temperatures — something the team does not see evidence of, Tice said. “All the ways we have of examining these rocks on the rover suggest that they were never heated in a way that could produce the leopard spots and poppy seeds,” Tice explained. “If that’s the case, we have to seriously consider the possibility that they were made by creatures like bacteria living in the mud in a Martian lake more than three billion years ago.” Cheyava Falls may have begun as a mixture of deposited mud and organic compounds that eventually cemented to become rock, according to the research. Later on, water may have penetrated through cracks in the rock, depositing minerals to create the calcium sulfate veins and leopard spots. “What’s exciting about these finds, this sort of combination of mud and organic matter that has reacted to produce these minerals and these textures, is that when we see features like this are often the byproduct of microbial metabolisms that are consuming organic matter and making these minerals as a result of those reactions,” Hurowitz said. Hurowitz also acknowledged that there are nonbiological ways to create features like the leopard spots. “What we need to do from here is to continue to do additional research in laboratory settings here on Earth,and ultimately bring the sample from this rock backhome to Earth, so that we can make the final determination for what process actually gave rise to these fantastic textures,” he said. Scientists are still in the process of analyzing the geologic context of the sample, but the new paper represents an overview of how they currently understand the Cheyava Falls rock, Stack Morgan said. More papers are expected over the next year or so. “While we were exploring the Bright Angel area, we basically threw the entire rover science payload at this rock, and so we’re pretty close to the limits of what the rover can do on the surface in terms of making progress on that particular question,” Stack Morgan said. Since landing on Mars, Perseverance has crossed Jezero Crater and explored an ancient river delta in search of microfossils of past life. The rover has been collecting samples along the way that were intended to be returned to Earth by future missions. But it’s currently unclear how NASA would return the samples to Earth as the agency grapples with the White House’s proposal toslash NASA’s science budgetby as much as half. “We’re looking at how we get the sample back, or other samples back,” Duffy said. “What we’re going to do is look at our budgets, we look at our timing, and you know, how do we spend money better, and you know, what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly? And so that’s a current analysis that’s happening right now.” To ultimately answer the question of whether life has ever existed on the red planet, returning the samples is necessary, scientists say. “Bringing this sample back to Earth would allow us t",2025-09-10T15:54:18.134Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/10/science/nasa-mars-sapphire-falls-rock-sample,Ashley Strickland,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1-pia26368-perseverance-finds-a-rock-with-leopard-spots.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:34:58
Rare ‘tooth-in-eye’ surgery restores man’s vision after two decades,"When Brent Chapman was 13, he took ibuprofen during a Christmas basketball game. It was a drug he had taken before, but what happened next was anything but routine: He had a severe reaction that caused burns all over his body, including on the surface of his eyes. Chapman was in a coma for 27 days. He lost his left eye to an infection and lost most of his vision in the other. His body recovered, but his vision fully never returned. “For the last 20 years, I’ve been having close to 50 surgeries trying to save this eye, most of them cornea transplants,” Chapman said of his right eye. “We would put a new cornea in. It would last sometimes just a few months or even up to years, but it would just kind of never heal.” But Dr. Greg Moloney, clinical associate professor of corneal surgery at the University of British Columbia, was able to restore Chapman’s sight this year with a rare procedure that involved implanting Chapman’s own tooth into his eye. “I’m very happy and am just taking in the world again, appreciating the little things. It’s been kind of surreal and kind of a euphoric feeling to it,” Chapman said. The procedure, also known as tooth-in-eye or osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, involves removing a patient’s tooth, sewing a piece of it into the cheek and placing the structure into their eye. “It’s a situation where a standard corneal transplant simply won’t work,” said Dr. Vicente Diaz, assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual science at the Yale School of Medicine. Diaz was not involved with Chapman’s case but treats people who haveStevens-Johnson syndrome, the rare and sometimes fatal drug reaction that caused Chapman’s blindness. The condition causes severe inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes, including the eyes. In some cases, Diaz said, the immune system attacks and destroys the limbal stem cells that are essential for keeping the cornea clear. Without these cells, corneal tissue becomes scarred and keratinized, as if the cornea has skin growing over it, blocking light from reaching the retina. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be triggered by any medication or infection, although certain drugs such as seizure medications, gout medications and antibacterial sulfa drugs carry a higher risk. There are also certaingenetic factorsthat could put someone at a higher risk of developing the disorder. Diaz noted that it can occur at any point in a person’s life, even after previous exposure to the same trigger without incident. In a healthy eye, the cornea acts like a windshield, allowing light to pass through to the lens and then to the retina, where it is converted into electrical signals sent to the brain. The cornea’s clarity depends on adequate lubrication and a steady renewal of cells by limbal stem cells. In conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, those systems fail. When the cornea is permanently opaque and the eye rejects a cornea transplant, surgeons sometimes turn to tooth-in-eye surgery. A canine tooth, which is the longest tooth in the human mouth, is extractedfrom the jaw, along with a thin layer of bone around the tooth that provides support and blood, keeping it alive. The tooth is then shaved into a 4 millimeter-thick block and drilled to hold a plastic optical cylinder, explained Dr. Ben Kang, Chapman’s oral maxillofacial surgeon and division head of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery at Vancouver General Hospital. The shaved tooth, with the lens in place, is implanted into the patient’s cheek or eyelid for several months, allowing soft tissue to grow around it. “The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place,” Moloney said. “It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own.” The next step is to make a hole in the front of the patient’s eye to create space for the new complex. Once the tooth-lens complex is integrated with living tissue, it is surgically attached to the front of the eye, replacing the damaged cornea’s function. Tissue from inside the patient’s mouth is used to cover the tooth part of the device, giving the new eye a pink shade. Light can then pass through the clear lens to the retina, enabling vision again, provided that everything behind the cornea — the retina and optic nerve— remains healthy. Moloney said there are two types of candidates for the surgery: people like Chapman, who have tried every other procedure, or those who are so severely affected by their initial disease that doctors know from the outset that other options won’t work. The surgery, which can take over 12 hours across two stages, is rare and performed by only a handful of specialists worldwide. But for people who qualify, success can mean regaining nearly normal vision. “It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world,” Moloney said. “It’s highly emotional for us.” Chapman’s tooth was extracted in February, and the structure was placed into his eye in June. His last surgery, which straightened the lens to correct visual distortion, took place August 5. Chapman was fitted with glasses on August 13 and now has 20/30 vision, meaning he can see details at a distance of 20 feet that a person with perfect vision can see at 30 feet. The first thing he saw after his surgery was the skyline from Moloney’s 16th-floor office. “It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting. When you’re blind or low-vision, you’re not seeing that, and you’re kind of in your head more. There’s a lot more mental chatter, and it can be difficult,” Chapman said. “Dr. Moloney and I made eye contact for the first time, and we both got quite emotional. I haven’t really made eye contact in 20 years.” Before the tooth-in-eye surgery, Chapman was close to giving up hope. “We definitely didn’t have any more options. The transplants were lasting such a short time, and they were becoming more risky to do surgically,” he said. “Emotionally, even when I would get a new one, I knew it wasn’t going to last. This opened a new door for me and a new chapter in my life. This also provides more stability.” Chapman is looking forward to traveling – with Japan being on the top of the list – but he wants to “just see the world and take it all in.” “I have a niece and a nephew that are 4 and 2. They’re just so cute and so much fun,” he said. He is also a massage therapist and is looking forward to working again. “I’ve had a lot of time off work in the last couple of years with surgeries. I can give back and help people in pain and not make everything about me, and I think psychologically, that’s very helpful.” Above all, Chapman said, he is excited to dream again and “to not be limited by the instability of this condition and be able to plan and think ahead.” “Before, I would always be afraid to plan because I’m afraid I’ll need emergency surgery or have an infection. It was so unpredictable, I would make these plans, and it would be heartbreaking when I couldn’t do them,” he said. Having “human connection again visually” is something that people take for granted but is very powerful for people with poor vision. “We’ve been with him since he was a teenage boy. He’s waited till he’s 34 to get that,” Moloney said. “We’ve all waited a long time.”",2025-09-15T11:09:01.145Z,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/tooth-in-eye-surgery,Asuka Koda,tech,N/A,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/tooth-in-eye-surgery-restores-vision-image1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2026-02-03 16:35:06
